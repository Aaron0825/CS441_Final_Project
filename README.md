# Personalized Writing Style Text Detector

The code is in Code folder and data is in Data folder.

Raw_Data contains only the human wriiten text I currated, Cleaned_Data contains both human written and Ai generated texts plus the labels. 

data_preparation.py is how I called gpt-4o to generate texts, methods_experiment.py is how I tested 10 approaches to my objective and selected the best one, application.py is the web app that implemented the method into a functioning web app.
