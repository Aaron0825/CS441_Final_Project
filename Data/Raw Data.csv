"However in popular opinion, the first thing that comes to people’s mind is a figure of a strong, sturdy man who fights bad guys or monsters. But how was this stereotype planted into our brain? Just like most of us believe that justice will prevail, in our subconscious we always hope that an undefeatable being who’s on our side would protect us from the danger and injustice in our life. Furthermore, this is the reason why superman-like heroes were born. Throughout the history, human have always created this kind of super-human character in fantasy, to create a figure for them to worship; in 2500BC Sumer we got Gilgamesh, in 1000 BC Israel we got King David, in 600BC Greece we got Heracles, in 200AC China we got Guan Yu, in 500AC England we got King Arthur, in Medieval German we got Siegfried, in 18th century Spain we got Zorro, in 1990s America we got action movie heroes, and now we have marvel super heroes."
"Heroism, an ideology that was implanted in mankind since the ancient time, has been a significant factor that influence our thinking, culture, literature, or even our daily life. From Gilgamesh to Superman, we always wish that there’s a hero who can protect us from danger. While in present, someone believe that things need to be done by humans; not gods, not heroes, but humans. As a consequence of this thinking, it’s the rise of anti-heroism. Finally, the bandwagon effect cause by heroism can cause a lot of problems to the society. People who are hypnotized by the idea believe their own fantasy, they can harm others or themselves very easily. In conclusion, a hero is a being with limited power, it has its own justice and it will never betray it, it knows its limit and it will not be arrogant, it knows what it must do and it will achieve it; lastly, a hero can be anybody."
"“Humph!” the white man grunted. They had arrived at their destination during his complaint. It was a run-down shed on the brink of the plantation, doubling as the entrance of an ownerless woods. “Clean it up before sunset. Or else the tip of a whip is the only thing you will taste tonight!” The cabin was really shabby; it was nearly impossible to renovate it before dusk, yet Tom didn’t talk back, because he knew it would only bring him more lashes. Fat Eric soon left after he assigned the task, while Tom worked hard for fear of whipping. During the process, Tom couldn’t help but wonder what or who this cottage was for as the building was obviously too small as a storage house; however, the whites would neither live in such garbage heap nor give the slaves a house. Tom didn’t have enough time to reach the answer before sunset, he bore several lashes that night."
"Hearing his master’s demand, Tom had no other choice but to accept it. Though he had no knowledge of taking care of others before, he still tried his best to keep good old Irwin safe and sound. Irwin spent most of his days spacing out and Tom came to his cabin every two hours to confirm his well-being and bring him meals. Once he wondered why the old man got such a retirement for average slaves who were usually worked to death, yet he couldn’t get any clues from the deranged senior or his ill-tempered master. Life continued like this for a few months and Tom kind of liked it; not only because he could get some exemption from manual labor, but also reduced the chance of him meeting Eric, which further spared him from possible whipping. However, the peaceful daily routine didn’t last long, tension rose in the South as a white man was hanged for inciting slave rebellion, rumors spread all over the county, the detest and fear in the whites’ eyes grew more and more obvious with each passing day. To make matters worse, several guns went missing from the arsenal while Mr. Jackson, the owner of the plantation, suspected that it was the slaves who stole the firearms and planned to overthrow him. "
"Research 2 started with a hypothesis: we are either born into or socialized into hating a sound. Seidle first analyzed people’s preference of sound and found that high intensity high frequency sound is not universally hated, for example people showed a significantly higher preference for baby crying than fork scratching on plate. He then compared the sound preference of general USA citizens and Tsimane people from Amazon rainforest, and Tsimane people who live in San Borja and those who remained in the jungle. He found that high intensity sound is much less preferable to the population living in industrialized areas. Another experiment Seidel conducted was to investigate young children’s sound preference, it was surprising to him that children from 3 to 6 years old barely show any sound aversion, and the kids from 7 to 10 showed, even though not as strong as adults’, a relatively more skewed aversion for sounds. Thus Seidel concluded that sound preference is a trait that was learned through socialization, not a biological factor."
"Research 4 asked an important question: though having the same answer to a question, do AIs have the same thought process like a human being. The purpose of this research is to mass produce auditory response data through convolutional neural networks of artificial intelligence, since it is cheaper and quicker than hiring human participants. But before that Seidel needs to prove that AI processes audio information like humans, else the data will be pointless. After comparing the cortical firing pattern of the human brain with thousands of layers of tensors in AI models, he finally confirmed that one specific layer responds similarly to the human brain when processing audio. He also found that AIs trained to multi-task function more similarly than those designed to concentrate on a single task. Thus Seidel concluded though still needing more research, some AI models may be plausible for mass producing experiment data with near-perfect accuracy. As a computer science student concentrating in machine learning, I look forward to real world application of this research."
"However, even putting the non-STEM courses in consideration, ANTH 100 is a very “broad” course. The content of this course is so broad that there is no other definition for this course other than “study about humans”. Throughout this semester we went from the biological evolution of human species to history of racial theories then jumping back and forth to topics like formation of a society, gender and sex, and a variety of different subjects, branching out to sociology, linguistics, politics, and more fields of studies. This is exactly what I like about this course: it is like reading the encyclopedia for the first time when I was eight, I learned so much interesting new knowledge that I will probably never learn if I did not take ANTH 100. I especially love the videos incorporated into the lectures, the two videos that impressed me the most are the documentary on Mongolian nomads and the breakdown of fictional languages. The documentary shocked me with the existence of modernized nomads herding sheep on motorbikes, and as a hardcore Lord of the Ring who studied Khuzdul in junior high, I genuinely enjoyed learning other fictional languages.

"The most visually-stunning artwork was an installation art by Makena Thompson, or Unangax̂ of Egegik by her Inuit name. It was a gillnet woven with multiple materials and several decoration pieces. The art was inspired by Thompson’s Nana (grandma) in Alaska, who worked in commercial salmon fishing that raised two generations of her descendents. In honor of her Nana and the traditional Inuit way of living, fishnet became the core of Thompson’s art. The center piece is the traditional salmon gillnet, but the edge is woven with nylon of different colors, symbolizing the blend of tradition and modern cultures. On the net hung a few pieces of colored glass, which were collected by Thompson from a nearby river in her childhood in Alaska. The two ends of the net were respectively decorated with a cedar cork and a graduation cord. The cork is a heirloom that traced its history back to the 1950s, and the cord is Thompson’s own graduation cord. The linking of the past and present by the fishnet represented the essence of this artwork: “No matter how the world changes, the bond with my root always perseveres”.

"I talked to my friend Arnob on our way from Stewart center to Corec after class. Our conversation was mainly about workout (as we’re heading to the gym), especially on the workout menu and his comment on using testosterone. We’re walking and talking so we don’t always face each other, but I always look into his eyes when I’m making a point. Recently Arnob started to use testosterone and tried to convince me to join him. I joked around and tried to divert the topic as long as possible, I didn’t want to straight up reject him and hurt his feelings. I can relate to him because he was also fat like me, it took him 4 years in the gym to be buffed as he is today. He got into a bottleneck recently as he could not get any stronger without medication, and testosterone was his way out. However, in the end he pushed too hard and I had to tell him with a straight face, I don’t want to use any drug, whether it is steroids or testosterone. He backed down for now but I’m pretty sure he will pick this up some other day, that is just who he is."
"The picture on the bottom left is a Taiwanese teenager making a mockery out of the president during an interview. His reaction is the portrayal of how most young Taiwaneses feel about this country nowadays: absurd. The ruling party only cares about elections, the birth rate is dropping, the economy is crumbling, the mafias are thriving, and these are just the tip of the iceberg. It is so desperate and so beyond saving that it makes us want to laugh, as it is the only thing we can do in this farcical society. The political and historical background of Taiwan is one of the major reasons why I choose to study abroad. The image on the top right is my middle school classroom, and it is taken at 8 p.m. Taiwan, like the rest of other east asian countries, is an examination hell. Private schools forced students as young as middle schoolers to stay at school and study until 10 p.m.; while public schools don’t have such rules, students generally go to cram schools afterwards. This type of cramming education is another major factor that goaded me to leave Taiwan."
"Personally, I believe McIntosh’s list is a generalized rather than accurate roster that determines who has special access and who gets marginalized at Purdue, there are too many loopholes that can be exploited and need specification. For example, item 39 states “If you have more than fifty books in your household” as a privilege. Is it implying “the financial capability to afford fifty books” a privilege or “raised in an intellectual household” a privilege? What if one has one hundred e-books in their ipad instead of fifty hardcopies? What if the family regularly visits the library but doesn’t keep books in the household? There are simply too many interpretations to be made, so I don’t consider this list accurate. Also, I feel like some items need to be subtracted or modified for they don’t fit into Purdue’s current condition. For example, item 5 states “If you rely, or have relied, primarily on public transportation” a disadvantage. This is especially not true, for most of us travel by our own two feet, does this make us more privileged than those who take buses? Not to mention CityBus is free no more! Instead the list should make “primarily travel by personal motorized vehicle” a privilege, not “rely primarily on public transportation” a marginalization."
"In Episode One - The Difference Between Us, the documentary focuses on unraveling common myths about race and reinterprets the concept with modern standards: It debunks the belief of races as biological categories but reaffirms races as cultural identification. The video states the idea of biological race was fabricated solely for the purpose of proving one race is better than the other, it is fake science that forces lines between dots to reach a predetermined conclusion. With modern genetic studies we know that the variation of DNA sequence between homo sapiens is extremely small compared to other intraspecies differences, the genetic variation of two fruit flies might be as different as a human to a chimpanzee. Thus, most of us are practically genetically alike, it is only that one in a million gene strand that contribute to our appearance is different, then the concept of race is created because we are most used to identify by physical appearance. In fact, a black man can be more genetically similar to a white man than another black man, and vice versa. "
"During my time with production line quality management, I not only improved my technical skills but also saw how important innovation is in computer science. I faced tough problems that needed persistence and creativity to solve. Quickly, I learned to use resources like communication techniques and collaborative teamwork to overcome the obstacles. This experience made my passion for computer science stronger. It showed me I'm committed to research that tackles real-world issues. My experiences in computing have prepared me well for grad school. I'm sure my love for tech and my ability to work with people from all walks of life will help me make a positive impact in the future. Apply my knowledge in computer science, dive into exciting research, and team up with fellow software engineers to help improve the world for the greater good."
"Whether it was school or family education, I was always taught to be nice to everyone, especially to the elderly and the disabled. My parents told me that generosity is a virtue, and the world will be a better place if everyone is willing to lend a helping hand. The story took place when I was a sixth grader, on my way to a convenience store to buy dinner. I saw a granny sitting on the stairs in front of the store, looking around and maybe in need of help. As soon as we met eyes, she approached me. With her shaky voice she told me she lost her wallet and needed 200 dollars to call a taxi back home, she said everyone but me brushed her off and begged me to help her. I was very hesitant, 200 dollars was all I was given, if I gave it all to her, I would need to starve till tomorrow when my parents got home. In the end, I followed my conscience and gave her the money. Now here comes the twist, my dad came home early that night and decided to bring me to a midnight diner as a reward for my kindness. However, as we passed by that same convenience store, I saw that granny again. She was still sitting on the staircase, but this time with a bottle of soju in her left hand and a lighted cigarette in another. I was shocked and confused, I didn’t understand why she didn’t make her way back home, I didn’t grasp the truth behind this “poor helpless old woman” hoax until much later. It turns out she’s a local hobo who regularly pesters bypassers for booze and smokes. I just happened to bump into her and was an easy target. "
"The most straightforward factor that contributed to my concern is the Absurdistan, or the double speaking I encounter in my everyday life. As you must also know as a denizen of Novotroitsk, the metallurgy industry has always been the pride and backbone of this town; and as the editor of the only newspaper in this town, I assume you also heard of the recent factory layoff that suspended dozens of workers indefinitely. The official statement from the manager claimed that this is merely a “temporal adjustment of personnel”, yet me and my fellow workers all knew this suspension was due to the shortage of chemical solution. The shipment of hydrochloric acid and fluorspar, the critical chemical used in the process of extraction and smelting, had been reducing months before the layoff. And this decrease in shipment, I speculated, is due to the new chemical company we formed a new partnership with a few years ago. I still remember the day when the manager announced the new contract  signed with InfraLeuna, a Western Germany corporation whose subsidiary specializes in the production of industrial chemicals. At the time when all western enterprises were labeled as evil capitalist, ruthless imperialist, and oppressors of the working class; this statement was quite shocking for all the factory workers. However, the manager soon released a new statement that claimed that InfraLeuna “realized their wrongdoing in assisting capitalist oppression” and “turned to the Union in hope of supporting the great communist work”. If I recall correctly, the statement was even published on Novotroitsk News! As a result, we accepted this new arrangement without much comment until last week, the very day we were put on an indefinite suspension. "
" At the beginning of the episode, a reporter greets Bart out of politeness, while Bart replies with a stereotypical redneck response “Who the hell are you?”.  At the same time Bart is chewing a barley straw, which is another stereotype for American southerners. The exaggeration of uneducated Americans is shown here, for even the kids are acting like a mid-aged redneck. When Mr. Burns makes his debut on the TV show to announce his entrance of the election, everyone scoffs at him and wishes him to get lost. However, as Burns hired an actor portraying Charles Darwin who claims the three-eyed fish is an evolutionary leap instead of a hideous genetic mutation, a bunch of people immediately change their opinion on Burns, some even call him new blood for American politics. The uneducated Americans are easily manipulated by the information they receive, yet they don’t have the ability to tell right from wrong. The parody of Charles Darwin and the exaggeration of mass ignorance are displayed in this scene, the media has become a new tool for businessmen and politicians to control people."
"You wake up on a pile of golden flowers, you look around but no one is around, as you investigate the area you remember you fell down Mount Ebott, a place forbidden by the adults, also the habitat the monsters dwell. Welcome to the world of Undertale, here you play as a child to explore the underground and try to find a way back to the surface. During your adventure you will meet several monsters, but instead of savage monsters the adults told you, they are intelligent beings with emotion and soul. When you encounter a monster, you can choose to fight and kill it or try to communicate and make peace with it. If you spare the monsters and explore the underground peacefully, you will find that every character in the game has a story behind it, and all of their stories connect to each other to create the massive plot of Undertale. "
"While Undertale is, at the end of the day, a game steeped in fiction, the effects of its music on a player’s overall experience is very much grounded in reality. Look no further than the first encounter in the game, where we meet our titular antagonist, Flowey the flower. Flowey, as Aaron mentioned before, is indeed the final boss of the game, but from his initial charming and inviting demeanor, a player would be oblivious as to his ulterior motives. Flowey’s theme, titled, “Your Best Friend”, mirrors his innocent appearance with a cute, simplistic melody in the key of Ab major, lulling the player into a false sense of security. When Flowey does decide to show his true colors in the form of Omega Flowey near the end game, we hear this leitmotif once again, distorted, bizarre, and with an accelerated tempo, which induces a sense of fear and hatred in the player."
"At the end of the route, Flowey will tell you a way to reach the true pacifist route and restart the game before the final boss fight. You will fight the true form of Flowey, which is Asgore’s deceased son Asriel. This time you will save this last soul you didn’t save in the last run and reach the true happy ending. In the genocide route you choose to deal things with violence instead of mercy. To achieve this run you need to kill every monsters in the game, and as you continued to slay more and more monsters just because you want get the genocide ending, you will find yourself the true final boss and the monsters are the heroes who try to defeat you. When you finally kill everything that moves in the game, the soul of the first human who fell underground appears, he is the one and only friend of Asriel, also the narrator that guides you throughout the game. He will kill the protagonist and crash the game, force you to play this game over and over again, never leave him alone. "
"As influential as movies can be, the author can only recall one that envisions a world where humans live in harmony with nature—Black Panther. The nation of Wakanda surprisingly maintains its environment despite being, in canon, the most technologically-advanced country in the world. This is in large part because Wakanda lacks suburbs which, as proven in the United States, does more harm to the environment than urban territories. The very capital city of Birnin Zana is assimilated with nature, making it more sustainable and environmentally beneficial than any other in real life. Compounded with the fact that studies have shown that suburban lifestyle isn’t especially good for humans, the methodology that went into creating Wakanda looks more and more appealing. Wakandans chose to tell a story that differs from not only the titular antagonist Killmonger but also from many films of today, and the author champions this idea. Instead of a resigned undercurrent, the author wants movies of today to discuss climate change with an opportunistic viewpoint, one that would benefit not only the environment, but the general public as well. The author ends the essay with her own optimistic take on an ecologically-orientated story, rallying the audience into becoming one with nature and reconstructing a new narrative."
"The extreme weather occurring around the globe in recent years is the environmental issue being discussed in Weathering with You. Throughout the story, many people asked for Hina’s help to hope for good weather; whether it is important events such as weddings or petty wishes like “want to walk under the sun”,  Hina realized them all. Yet the price of the miracles was not only high but also cruel: Hina's special power came from her identity as a human offering to the god of weather, and every time she prayed for good weather her body became more and more transparent. Also the storms Hina cleared didn’t disappear, they were only delayed. As Hina stopped praying in fear of the transformation, all the bad weather struck back all at once. Rain flooded Tokyo, the city was on the verge of destruction. Finally, Hina could not bear to watch others suffer, she prayed one last time and disappeared from this world. As she fully transformed into a live offering, the rain stopped pouring and the wind halted howling, the world was saved by the sacrifice of a 16-year-old girl."
"To the US, this principle is not the most favorable but rather an acceptable one. America would never be happy to be at the giving end instead of the receiving end of economic merit, yet to reduce carbon emission globally, it is a necessary sacrifice. The United States will have to restart the various environmental policies previously canceled by the Trump Administration and fulfill the 26% reduction promise made in the Paris Agreement. In addition, the US needs to foster advanced technology industries in South America to shift their economic focus from heavy industry and exhaustive forestry. To prevent raising the cost of living and causing popular discontent, the US might need to cut short other budget expenses, such as national defense. To other developed countries, their conditions are very much the same to the states, just on a smaller scale. These nations need to continue or renew their carbon emission policy while aiding their neighboring developing nations like the US to South America, with the premise that these altercations won’t significantly increase the cost of living. The government and citizens of developed countries need to strike a balance between these conditions, which may involve decreasing luxury and other unnecessary expenses."
"To China, it should cease its current checkbook diplomacy and focus on solving its internal issues. China is the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, it needs to cut short its carbon emission by transitioning from fossil fuel to renewable energy. China is a country that suffers severe wealth inequality, most capital is in the possession of government officials and the merchants bonded with them. Besides implicit corruption, a significant amount of money is spent on China’s ally nations to politically compete with NATO nations instead of helping the poor Chinese citizens. These issues need to be resolved before China can efficiently cut down carbon emission while overcoming the financial instability brought by rapid economic growth. To India, the situation is almost identical to China. India’s wealth inequality has its convoluted roots in the caste system, corruption, religion, and external conflict. It is India’s responsibility to solve or at least mitigate its social and economic conundrums in order to allocate resources for emission reduction movements."
"Cost wise, while nuclear is not cheapest on the list yet it is definitely more affordable than fossil fuels, both coal and gas. As renewable energies are considerably cheaper than nuclear energy, its massive landuse and unreliability is a great concern. It takes ten times more land to establish an effective solar and wind power plant, the land that can be utilized far more economically efficiently. Speaking of efficiency, the conversion of either solar wind or geothermal energy into electricity hasn’t ever reached 50% since its invention. Compared to the 90% energy factor of nuclear energy, renewable energies alone won’t be able to provide electricity on a national, or even a regional scale. In addition to inefficiency, unlike nuclear and fossil fuels, renewables are often bound to the environment, solar power needs a sunny climate, Hydroelectricity requires waterfalls, … etc, in contrast to the reliable nuclear power plants that can produce electricity 24/7, renewable energies are simply not good enough.

"The assertion that we learn our most valuable lessons from struggling with our limitations rather than from enjoying our successes is a compelling one. While successes can certainly provide joy and satisfaction, it is often the challenges and difficulties that teach us the most profound and enduring lessons. I largely agree with this claim, though it is also important to recognize that successes can play a crucial role in reinforcing and validating the lessons learned through struggle. Struggling with limitations often forces individuals to confront their weaknesses, rethink their strategies, and develop resilience. For instance, Thomas Edison’s numerous failures in inventing the light bulb illustrate how struggles can lead to significant learning and eventual success. Edison famously stated that he had not failed but had found 10,000 ways that did not work. His persistence and problem-solving through repeated failures ultimately led to a groundbreaking invention that transformed modern life. This example underscores how grappling with limitations can be a powerful teacher, fostering persistence, creativity, and critical thinking."
"Similarly, athletes frequently experience growth through overcoming setbacks. Consider the story of Michael Jordan, who was famously cut from his high school basketball team. This early failure motivated him to work harder and refine his skills, ultimately leading to a highly successful career in professional basketball. Jordan’s struggle with rejection and limitation taught him valuable lessons about perseverance and self-improvement that were instrumental in his later achievements. His experiences demonstrate that struggles often provide the impetus for personal development and future success. On the other hand, successes can also offer important lessons and affirmations of one’s abilities. Achieving a goal can boost confidence, validate one’s efforts, and provide motivation for future endeavors. For example, a student who successfully completes a challenging academic project may gain confidence in their problem-solving abilities and become more motivated to tackle future challenges. Successes can also serve as milestones that reinforce the effectiveness of strategies and hard work, offering valuable feedback and encouragement."
"However, while successes provide positive reinforcement, they often do not compel the same level of self-reflection and growth as struggles do. Successes can sometimes lead to complacency, where individuals rest on their laurels rather than seeking continuous improvement. In contrast, overcoming limitations often requires a deeper level of introspection and adaptation. The process of addressing and overcoming difficulties can lead to more profound personal growth and a better understanding of one’s capabilities and potential. Moreover, challenges and limitations frequently teach individuals about the importance of resilience and the value of effort. For example, entrepreneurs who navigate financial difficulties or business failures often emerge with a greater understanding of risk management, strategic planning, and adaptability. These lessons are frequently more impactful and enduring than those learned from straightforward successes, which may not always require as much effort or introspection."
"It is pure irony that the Europeans, who profess to believe in the dignity of human beings, are the initiators, the perpetrators, and the sole beneficiaries of the most notorious human trafficking industry in the annals of mankind. Throughout the three hundred years history of the transatlantic slave trade, over 12.5 million Africans were snatched from their home and shipped to the plantations in the Americas, where they were dehumanized, commodified, bred like livestocks, then thrown away like rubbish. Although slavery was officially banned in the 19th century, it took one more century for people to fully recognize the true horror of the atrocities committed in the past. What could possibly rationalize this systematic deprivation of human rights? How did the Europeans of the early modern era sell millions of men as goods without remorse or guilt? Simply yet astonishingly, the Europeans justified the Atlantic slave trade with merely two reasons: money and moral."
"The Reformation, one of the most significant events in Christian history, was initiated by one troubled man. Martin Luther was an anxious Christian who suffered from existential crisis due to the fear of failing God’s expectation of him. Throughout the first half of his life, Luther searched for an answer, a solution that would free him from the persistent fears of damnation. During his study of penance at Wittenberg, Luther reached enlightenment. Luther came to his own realization that “eternal salvation came not from performing the religious good works of penance, but from faith, which was a gift from God”, he no longer need to worry about whether he did enough to be worthy of salvation, he just need to believe in God, and God would make the righteous judgment. From this moment of revelation, Luther would stray more and more from the path of Catholicism and eventually form his new version of Christianity. However, it was an extensive process of thought transformation that lasted for more than twenty years. From a confused believer to a stout opposer of papacy, Martin Luther underwent several drastic events that shift his mindset from time to time."
"We will utilize the web-scraped data we gathered up until now and continue to web-scrape the websites the mentors provide in the future. We will use the manually labeled well structured data in csv format as answer sheets for testing the accuracy for our large language models, and use the unfiltered web-scraped raw text data as the training data, which we will further divide into training, validation, and testing sets.  Also we will experiment with the size and format of raw text data, to see what batch size and file format produce the best desired output. Due to the immense time, cost, and data requirement needed to train a large language model from zero, we decided to adopt the pre-trained models from online sharing platforms and finetune the model to specifically extract manufacturing speaks from text data. The focus of this semester is Ollama, which we already experimented with several model families on. In the first sprint of the next semester we will also look into Hugging Face, another AI sharing platform, and explore more models we can possibly employ."
"World War I and the Napoleonic Wars, two of the most important modern wars, each left its own bloody yet significant marks on the annals of European history. Both wars were fueled by fervent nationalism, caused countless casualties, introduced advanced warfare, and led to substantial shifts in power and ideology not limited to the Europe continent but also the colonies around the globe. However, though the two wars hold many commonalities, they still possess several differences, especially in the experiences of frontline soldiers. The technological breakthrough in the 100 years between the two eras fundamentally altered the definition of war. The amount of casualties drastically increased in WWI, and the post-traumatic stress disorder was of much greater scale compared to the Napoleonic Wars. Overall, the life of a World War I soldier is more stagnant, unpredictable, and hopeless than a Napoleonic soldier due to the advanced weaponry, trench warfare, and the mass mobilization made possible in the 20th century."
"And as for why InfraLeuna cut back our supply, it was hard to not relate to the horrible accident that took place three years ago. Chernobyl not only left a huge scar on the direct victim of the incident, it also undermined the trust we had in the government. My sister Ludmila and her family living in Pripyat bore the brunt of that terrible disaster. I had a phone call with Ludmila the night before the explosion, we talked about the upcoming birthday of my precious little niece Sasha and my plan to visit them in May. That was the last time I heard from them in weeks. I didn’t even know about the disaster three days after it happened, and I knew something was off when Вре́мя claimed that the power plant was under control yet I could not contact my sister. It turned out my sister’s family was emergency evacuated out of the city in the midnight of April 27th, then in the following month they along with other residents of Pripyat were transported place to place, from decontamination sites to refugee camps, rural villages to unfamiliar towns; it took them a month to finally settle in Kyiv and inform me that they were tired but unharmed."
"Being “relieved” from my work recently, I finally had the opportunity to experience the infamous grocery queues. It was an awfully dull and wasteful occurrence, I waited from daybreak for six hours in the long and winding line, just to be disappointed by the farcical “goods” at the end of it. The shops didn’t even have the 100th of what they showed on TV: there was no meat, no vegetables, no milk, no fruit; there was nothing other than bread as hard as rock. Most importantly, they have no toilet paper. Not even a single sheet! Me and my family had to resort to rags made from old clothes and past newspapers! It is such a woeful situation, that both the metal we export and the groceries we import are in deplorable scarcity. I know it is a hard time for everybody, but things could be better. I wish my letter can raise the government’s awareness of what the people really need, instead of deluding themselves with propaganda that is too good to be true."
"The Gilded Age, an era marked as the pinnacle of “the American dream”, is one of the most luxurious years in American history. Under rapid economic growth and industrial expansion, mass urbanization took place and cities flourished, quality of life soared, everything seemed so glamorous and wonderful. However, under the canvas of the illustrious image, social issues bred; widespread corruption, outright racism, and rising unemployment slowly infested the society as people reveled in clubs and ballrooms. The Great Sheedy Trial, a murder case that occurred in Lincoln, Nebraska, demonstrated the typical racism that pervaded the Gilded Age. By examining the case of the black suspect Monday McFarland, the racial oppression concealed for ages is finally brought to the light."
"Before diving into the invention, we had to understand what exoskeleton is. Exoskeleton is also known as powered suit, it is a wearable mobile machine that is powered by a system of electric motors, pneumatics, levers, hydraulics, and a combination of technologies that allow for limb movement with increased strength and endurance; or in short a robot suit that can make you super strong.  Powered suit has implications in all walks of life, for example: it can be used for medical purposes, like utilizing exoskeleton as prosthetics for disabled or elderly. ""Step Rehabilitation Robots"" have helped individuals who lost the use of their legs from stroke, spinal cord injury or during aging by enabling system-assisted walking. Exoskeleton can also be used for military purposes, which advance soldiers’ physical affinity or prevent suffering from possible injuries. For example, the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS) had been employed in US army to increase mobility and reduce fatigue of Special Forces operators."
"The Guardian XO exoskeleton – the world’s first commercially-available full-body, battery-powered industrial wearable robot that delivers superhuman strength and endurance. In recent years exoskeletons have been increasingly invested into industry, with the goal of reducing worker injury and reducing errors due to fatigue, while The Guardian marks a milestone of the industry. To be distinguished from other brands, The Guardian is able to lift and manipulate up to 90 kg while virtually eliminating any physical strain, and also boasts as much as six hours of battery life. Historically, highly physical jobs have been relegated to larger and stronger people. If more and more companies adopt versatile exoskeletons, it means that there will no longer be physical barriers to entry for these roles. In essence, it will allow various highly-physical industries to maintain a more diverse talent pool."
"Despite the controversy his action caused, Luther didn’t aim to divide the church or even disrespect papacy in the slightest.  At the time Luther was still a loyal supporter of the church, a reformist discontent with the indulgence policy at best, he had no intention of undermining clerical authority. As a matter of fact, in order to clarify his motives and emphasize his identity of a good Christian loyal to the church, Luther wrote a letter to the pope of the time, Leo X. In Martin Luther’s letter to Pope Leo X, Luther paid the utmost respect to the pope by constantly referring to him as “the Most Blessed Father”, “your Holiness”, and various other titles. Luther viewed Leo X as the most holy man on earth, the candid judge that would clear his name from the defamation and support him in the indulgence controversy. In fact, Luther had such trust in the pope’s morality and judgment that in the letter he wrote “In your voice I shall recognize the voice of Christ directing you and speaking in you. If I have deserved death, I shall not refuse to die.”"
"The racism toward Monday McFarland is prominent ever since the inception of the case. Three days after Mary Sheedy’s confession, McFarland was captured from his workplace and taken into custody, for he refused to answer an officer's questions during work time. McFarland remained silent when being interrogated about the cane used in the murder, however, his perseverance was all in vain when the shop owner Hyman Goldwater claimed that McFarland bought the cane from his store. McFarland was then transferred to the notorious city jail for further examination where he experienced inhumane abuse. McFarland was locked in a “sweatbox”, a torture device that kept its victim in a sealed, cramped space while suffering dehydration and heat exhaustion in the awful environment. In addition to physical agony, the persisting death threat from the prosecutors slowly broke down his beaten mind. Finally, after hours of horrible torture, Monday McFarland confessed to be responsible for John Sheedy’s murder."
"Compared to free workers, slave labor held considerable advantages. First, slaves didn’t have human rights. The masters could rightfully discipline the slaves by any means necessary, which included torture and enprisonment, making the slaves more obedient and controllable than the indentured servants. Second, slaves are properties, not employees. The slavers could treat their subjects as draft animals instead of human beings. Unlike indentured servants who were “human” in debt, slaves were replaceable cogs in an agricultural machine named plantation. Slaves could be exploited extensively until they were eventually worn out and discarded, new “parts” could be easily replenished from the “hardware store” also known as Africa. In Caribbean plantations like Barbados, slaves were forced to work through day and nights due to the time sensitive nature of sugarcane processing, thus overwork was one of major causes of death for the Mesoamerican slaves. In addition, as slaves are defined as properties, they did not have a 5 year working contract like the indentured servants. The general life expectancy of Caribbean slaves is 7 years, which means in comparison to the contract workers, slaves provide 2 more years worth of profit before they work to death. "
"On the other hand, putting materialistic reasons aside, the Europeans morally justified the transatlantic slave trade by the domestic African slave trade and the pagan African religions. “Slavery is as old as the civilization itself.” said professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., “It played a key role in the African kingdoms, and was certainly an important component of the domestic economy of the Kingdom of Kongo”. Slavery was long integrated into the cultures of the African continent, enslavement of criminals, prisoners of war, and members of conquered tribes was a common practice not only crucial for the expansion of territory but also the accumulation of wealth. This tradition of slavery in Africa provided the Europeans an excuse to conduct human trafficking as a righteous business: The slaves were all captured by their fellow black kins, we white folks neither got our hands dirty nor requested the captures. We didn’t invent slavery in Africa, we merely made purchases from the existing market. "
"Luther was challenged to debate by many opposing figures, notably the Leipzig debate of 1519, where Luther confronted papal and clerical authority by questioning their astray from the Bible. This act ultimately led to Luther and his followers officially cutting ties with the church, and since then Luthor abandoned his moderate tone and adopted sharp criticism. Luthor launched an inflammatory pamphlet campaign and his change in attitude can be observed the best in his pamphlet: An Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation Concerning the Reform of the Christian Estate. In the pamphlet, Luthor broke down the power structure of the Catholic church and further proved the unorthodoxy of Catholic practices. Luthor denied the church of its noble “spiritual state” by proclaiming the priesthood of all believers. “In cases of necessity any one can baptize and give absolution, which would be impossible unless we were all priests”, Luther suggested the feasibility of sacraments by all Christians therefore the existence of clergy and papacy is redundant. Furthermore, even if the church is to exist, by the Scriptures, “priests, bishops or popes -- are neither different from other Christians nor superior to them”, they are merely “charged with the administration of the Word of God and the sacraments” "
"The most outright and consequential difference between WWI and the Napoleonic Wars is the weapons deployed. Napoleonic foot soldiers were generally equipped with smoothbore flintlock muskets having a firing rate of 2 ~ 3 rounds per minute, while frontline troops in WWI were armed with bolt action rifles which are not only capable of firing 12~20 rounds per minute but also with a far higher precision. The artillery batteries in Napoleonic era used cannons whose destructive ability solely relied on the mass and momentum of the projectiles, in comparison WWI gunnery crews utilized howitzers and mortars that fired explosive shells whose shockwave and shrapnels further enhanced the lethality. Aside from an upgrade from preexisting weaponries, WWI also introduced new devices of destruction unprecedented in human history. Rapid-firing machine guns empowered a handful of soldiers to outgun their enemies even with a lopsided number ratio, chemical weapons could smother enemies en masse with just a twist of valve on the gas canister. "
"Here I not only see how Claudius successfully misleads Laertes or namely corrupts him, but also the further exposure of the corruption of Claudius himself. Laertes is full of rage and hatred after knowing his father’s murder and witnessing his sister’s madness, he needs to find an outlet else he will be mad like Ophelia. Anger blinded his senses and unluckily the first man he encountered was Claudius, with manipulation of words Claudius lured Laertes into the worst situation, which will ultimately lead to his downfall. On the other hand, Claudius and Laertes’s claim to kill even in the church showed a great contrast between Hamlet’s mercy when he had the chance to slay Claudius. If one says Laertes was blinded by anger then Claudius is motivated by pure selfishness, his desire to accomplish his own goal can surpass any law and order, including moral values and religious rites."
"According to dictionary.com, the meaning of toxic is “something harmful or pernicious, as to happiness or well-being.” This is a common word and its meaning is obvious. When we think of the word toxic, we think of poisonous substances such as a bite from a snake, or a chemical reaction that is harmful. Unfortunately in the year 2018, the word became the word of the year, which can be interpreted in various ways. From a political perspective, the word was searched up due to a major incident in 2018. In March 4, 2018, the use of Novichok agent was identified in the attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, which was suspected to be utilized by Russia as it could be obtained by a very limited number of people in the world. With the rising tension between the U.S and Russia, such a toxic substance was soon searched and discussed by millions of people. From a social perspective, the phrase “toxic masculinity” stands out in the year 2018. Toxic masculinity involve cultural pressures for men to behave in a certain way, with the #Me Too and Times Up movement, people gather together in order to abolish toxic masculinity."
"“For the first half of his life Martin Luther was representative of the spiritual anxieties of many late medieval Christians – who were concerned about the state of their eternal souls.” Yet what differed Luther from other perturbed Christians is the conclusion he reached and the actions he committed to prove his faith. For Luther, Protestantism is his salvation; his reluctance and resistance to the church and papacy is him fighting for his life, once refuted, he would fall back down to the purgatory of self doubt and fear of damnation. Therefore, he could not afford to lose. The second half of Luther’s life is dedicated to validate his answer, from humble suggestion to outright rebuttal, the increasing disrespect and animosity toward the pope is the evidence of him gradually regaining confidence in himself and Christian faith."
"The Trial itself provided historians a clear view of racial discrimination in the era. After McFarland’s confession, Mary Sheedy and Monday McFarland were held on trial for first-degree murder and conspiracy. With a brief examination of the juries, the judges decided that McFarland’s testimony would be sufficient evidence to corroborate their guiltiness. However, the attorneys argued that several pieces of evidence were fabricated, for a witness Novia Snell was proven forced to file fake information against the two defendants. In addition, the most critical piece of evidence, Monday McFarland’s confession, was obtained through the means of torture and extortion. As fruit of the poisonous tree can not be eaten, evidence gained with illegal methods can not be considered valid either. As the trial continued, the prosecutors intended to use McFarland as a tool against Mary Sheedy by emphasizing McFarland’s confession, however, their proposal ended with failure for McFarland claimed he had confessed falsely in fear of death threat. The manner the juries and the police demonstrated throughout the whole case showed how the judicial system is unfair to black suspects: a black man can be captured without warranty, forced confession with torture, and convicted without sufficient evidence."
"Iron beasts named tanks rampaged through the battlefield, spewing death from their muzzles while crushing everything that stood in their path. Reconnaissance aircrafts circled above the battleground, like birds of prey they searched for the next victim to strike. Compared to the Napoleonic Wars, WWI was like hell materialized on earth. Napoleonic soldiers experienced, or at least could imagine what volley fire and bayonet charge would be like; however, WWI soldiers could not have foreseen the destructive power of modern weaponries. With just a pull of the trigger, a dozen lives could be gone. It was a surreal, nonsensical circumstance seeing both your limbs and all your comrades gone after an artillery volley. A really loud blast, bright lights, then everything left are mangled corpses and a big smoldering crater. Modern weaponries made WWI a far more traumatic experience than the Napoleonic Wars for both the attackers and the defenders."
"As the news of McFarland’s confession reached the public’s ear, the black suspect became a marionette dancing in the hands of racist media hype. The press used McFarland as a propaganda for racial discrimination. Several racist titles such as “Will the Negro Testify?” and “The Nigger Murderer” were constantly employed in local newspaper, while the illustrations of McFarland were smeared images of a black barbarian who was kept in a cage. Moreover, the preconceived notions of black men’s inclination to commit crime was also exhibited in journals and magazines. Despite the fact that the trial hadn’t even started yet, the media already presumed McFarland as the murderer, and further encouraged the public to condemn and persecute the suspect. Due to this phenomena the police even had to keep McFarland protected in the bridewell to secure the convict’s personal safety during the trial. The racist terms and offensive images of Monday McFarland employed by the media reflected the derogatory stereotype of African Americans during the Gilded Age, while the media violence he faced during trial portrayed a clear image of the racial discrimination the black race confronted at that time."
"The plot where Claudius questions Hamlet about where the corpse of Polonius is impresses me the most. Hamlet’s response is rather indirect, he tells Claudius that Polonius has become the dinner of the worms. Hamlet declared that maggot is the emperor of all diets, because it is the end of the food chain; no matter if you are a wolf or a sheep, a king or a slave, we all end up in worms’ belly. We are the livestocks of worms: just like how pigs eat and fatten up themselves just to be eaten by humans, people do their best to make wealth, gain power, fatten themselves throughout their lives, only to be devoured by the worms in the end. Also, mentioning “A certain convocation of politic worms” is not only alluding to Claudius and the officials of the court, but also insinuating the Diet of Worms, an imperial diet held by the Holy Roman Empire’s Charles V in the Imperial Free City of Worms. At the end of the Diet, the Emperor issued the Edict of Worms, a decree which condemned Martin Luther as “a notorious heretic” and banned citizens of the Empire from propagating protestant ideas. The comparison of Charles V and Martin Luther is a perfect reflection of Claudius and Hamlet, the corrupted versus the integrity, or the oppressor versus the rebellion."
"Among the numerous works I crafted, I am proud of an action figure the most. The creation of the figure took place when I was an elementary student. As a ten-year-old kid, I used up all the scraps available: correction tape parts, used up lighters, rubber bands, bolts and nuts. I let my thoughts go wild and my hands moved on their own. I cut and glued the parts together again and again, the screwdriver in my hand never stopped spinning, I even stuck a light bulb into its head to make the eyes glow. Finally, the action figure was finished two days later, it came out to be a 30 centimeters tall robot. It was later given out on Christmas present exchange, and my present undoubtedly was the coolest among all."
"Two hours. That’s how long the Whites had been firing their tubes of fire and death at the Red Sticks’ barricade to no avail. Our sizable army of Lower Creek, Cherokee, and White soldiers had been stationed on this vantage point atop a steep hill since the early morning, but our initial edge over the battle had long since subsided. The log-and-dirt fortification seemed to devour any and all incoming damage, and the tally of casualties on both sides still stood at an emphatic zero—a number that was sure to change very soon.  “Sharp, isn’t he, Chitto?” muttered a fellow Lower Creek beside me, gesturing at the figure that was leading our motley band of warriors. “Sharp as a knife, he is.” His voice oozed with resentment that had been building even before the Whites had sought our assistance. “When’s he gonna try ‘nother one of his brilliant plans, eh?”"
"I couldn’t help but scoff at the general’s lofty statement. The Red Sticks were nothing if not tenacious, and it boggles the mind to think that someone would still underestimate them. I have hunted enough wild beasts to know that a cornered fox is often more dangerous than the hungriest wolf. Scouts had reported around a thousand Red Stick warriors defending the secluded village of Tohopeka, each of whom ready to fight to their last gasp of air. In one of our prior skirmishes, I was dealt a savage blow by one of their notorious scarlet war clubs, and I was not eager to endure that excruciating pain once again. My musings of the past were cut short by distant gunshots and screams, emanating from the village. Coffee had successfully infiltrated Tohopeka.  “That’s our cue, gentlemen,” the general said with a giddy, almost child-like grin, “let the battle truly begin. 39th Infantry, charge!” The command had barely left his lips before the battalion began to surge forward, knives and daggers protruding from all angles like the quills of a porcupine."
"Although the true assailant of John Sheedy is never brought to justice, the trial ended with the victory of the defendants, declaring the recession of racism, sexism, and widespread corruption pervaded the Gilded Age. Nevertheless, the treatment toward black suspect Monday McFarland uncovered the deep-rooted racism in America since the first African slave stepped on the coast of Virginia, and the discrimination toward the black race remains prominent even until the modern era. Through the perspective of biased media and authorities of the time, the Great Sheedy Murder Trial offers a chance to dive into the core of the corrupted society of the Gilded Age. The Trial not only serves as a valuable historical document, but also a warning for the later generations to not commit the same error again."
"The closing of the Frontier was a significant event that symbolized the end of the westward movement and the start of a new era. The Frontier was once a land of chance and danger, there were few who could survive and prosper yet everyone was free to try. People can randomly select a wildland to farm but first he had to pass the Oregon Trail, one can strike it rich overnight during Gold Rush yet he may be robbed by outlaws on his way home. One of the significance of the end of the frontier is the decadence of the American dream. Before the closing of the frontier, America was a land of opportunity, everyone had the chance to find his own way to success with a little limit; the spirit of the era was that if you worked hard enough, anything is possible. However, as people started to move into the West and the government began to regulate the area, freedom was seen no more. The advance in transportation derived jobs such as cowboys and other spiritual symbols of the Wild West, while the regulation of government enabled people’s freedom with land and their lifestyle. The free pioneer spirit of America seemed to lose a part of it during the era."
"After what seemed like an eternity, my fingers finally gained purchase on the summit of the fortification. As I hoisted myself up, a frantic cry of “Houston!” from below caught my attention. A White soldier had collapsed behind the cover of a hut, an arrow lodged in his upper thigh. The Red Stick warrior who had shot him was rushing towards his supine figure, war club raised to deal the death blow. Still perched upon the breastwork, I notched my own arrow and took careful aim. The projectile pierced the back of the warrior’s neck right as he brought his club down, the momentum of his swing sending him sprawling headfirst into the side of the hut, splintering wood and painting the interior with sporadic spurts of brilliant crimson. “I just saved a White man’s life,” I thought as I scrambled down the other side of the breastwork, jumping the last few feet. “Let’s see if it was worth my arrow.”"
"Moreover, according to John Barbot, an employee of a French slave trading company, the slaves might be better off with the European masters rather than African slavers. “These slaves are severely and barbarously treated by their masters, who subsist them poorly, and beat them inhumanly, as may be seen by the scabs and wounds on the bodies of many of them when sold to us.” Barbot described the brutality of local slave masters “This barbarous usage of those unfortunate wretches, makes it appear, that the fate of such as are bought, and transported from the coast to America, or other parts of the world, by Europeans, is less deplorable, than that of those who end their days in their native country.” From this account, Europeans viewed themselves as saviors rather than oppressors, and this condescending perspective can also be seen in the laws to regulate slavery."
"Everything has changed since I entered senior high school. Being cool or funny is no longer people’s concern; instead, they line up with the ones with better grades and ability. I felt like I lost my character all of a sudden, like a stranger in a foreign place. It still seems like normal high school life, I made several new friends and blended into a clique, yet I could no longer feel the easiness in junior high. I became a yes man who seldom expressed my opinion, and I often felt inferior to peers, for I’m the only one who didn’t have any specialty. This circumstance got worse as time went on. I became more and more apprehensive, both to my present and future. I hate the dilemma I'm in. I felt like I'm just a nobody who can be replaced by anybody, and I fear that I will remain like this even until I enter the workforce. I wanted to change, I wanted to find my own value yet I don’t know what to do. I tried several things, while just ending up finding I can never surpass others and become special."
"Born in Kumamoto, Japan, Aimer grew up in an environment full of music; her father has his own band, so she started to play the piano when she was in elementary school. Influenced by her father, the music styles Aimer plays often are close to Jazz; moreover, she had lived abroad before,  this also had a great effect upon her English songwriting ability. Sadly, this young genius lost her voice at the age of fifteen, so she stopped all her music and music-related activities. Afterwards, she received silent treatment to recover her voice; however, the doctor told her that after silent treatment, her voice would be completely different. Half a year later, Aimer’s voice slowly recovered, and her voice became what we hear nowadays;  slightly husky sound line, quiet and magnetic mid-bass, spectrum style voice in high-pitch, her unique voice which has high identity is quite distinctive and individual. Later on, she gave herself the stage name “Aimer”, which means “to love” in French."
"This single “Loser” was announced in 2016, it was also the first time Yonezu Kenshi tried dancing for his own MV. The reason for this was Yonezu Kenshi said he wanted this MV to be cool, and what would be the coolest thing in an MV? If the singer himself danced in the MV would indeed be super cool！But when it comes to dancing, Yonezu Kenshi is really not good at it, all the sport he did before was playing tennis while in the junior high, so the dance training was an utterly hard time for him; luckily, he got an excellent dancing teacher, Tsujino Tomoaki, who also was the choreographer for Sia’s “Alive”, so he was able to finish his dancing course.  The whole song “Loser” describes Yonezu Kenshi himself as an underdog; this song may look negative in appearance, but actually it’s telling us that ” Just because we are underdogs, so we have the right to bark.”"
"Born in Tokushima, Japan, 1991; Yonezu Kenshi got in touch with music at age 11 for the first time in his life. He formed his first band, Late Rabbit Edda, with his friends when he was in grade 9. Later, this band attended a music festival called Flash Riot, which is a festival for young musicians. Late Rabbit Edda passed the first audition but got weeded out on the second audition. After graduating from high school, Yonezu Kenshi moved to Osaka to study at an art specialist university, but he was bored after a year of study, so he quitted the university; on the other hand, the band dismissed due to the divergence in concept. Actually, Yonezu Kenshi started to post his own music on a Japanese music website, Nico Nico Douga, with the name “Hachi” since 2009. He did the songwriting and drawing for MV all by himself, yet he didn’t sing in his music video, he used the singing software Vocaloid instead of singing himself. The songs he posted on Nico Nico soon became a hurricane and some of them were viewed by over a million people, that is when people began to pay close attention to Hachi; the most iconic songs he posted in this period are World End Umbrella, Panda Hero, and Clock Lock Works."
"Materialistically, the immense profit brought by the slave trade alone is enough to convince most people to perform the misdeed. However, the Europeans went further and attempted to whitewash their actions ethically. The slave traders characterized themselves as beneficiaries of vested interests and saviors for unconverted heathens. They claimed that they only profited from the existing African slave market, yet ignored the fact that their increasing demand spurred the growth of slave capture by many folds; they professed that the Africans reached true happiness through the enlightenment of Christianity, while hypocritically tortured the slaves with whips and grueling labor. In the end, both justifications were just excuses, Europeans were driven by greed and pride, the insatiable longing for more wealth and the arrogance of one race is superior to another. The Europeans enslaved 12.5 millions African for over three centuries due to their own selfish deeds, this is a fact that no excuse can justify."
"Whisky is a generic term for all distilled spirits made from cereals. Although traditionally, many people think that whiskey is made from barley, it is not. This situation is somewhat similar to brandy, although many people think that only distilled wine made from grapes is called brandy, but in fact, the term brandy refers to all distilled spirits made from fruits. Whisky can be separated into many kinds, American, Canadian, Australian, Danish…etc.  Among all, my first recommendation is Johnnie Walker Select Casks Bourbon whisky, the whisky  is brewed in the American Bourbon oak barrels, matured for at least 10 years, and finished with the rye barrels for the first time. In addition to retaining a complex multi-layered smooth mouthfeel, and graceful flavors of vanilla, cream and pepper from the rye."
"Alan Walker is the youngest and the most popular electronic artist around the world recently. He is best known for his single “Faded”, the song has already got over 1.8 billion views and became the most frequently used music on youtube. He has created many other great songs such as “Alone”, “Spectre” ,”Sing me to sleep”, and “Tired”……etc. Alan’s greatest style is to present the light side of life through hopeless darkness, his music always let you feel sad first before raising your heart all the way to heaven. Alan Walker’s music is truly the most inspiring of all. Tim Bergling is a genius musician, DJ, and remixer known as Avicii. Avicii rose to prominence in 2011 with his single “Levels”. After then, he had released lots of great albums and singles, such as “True”,”Stories”,”the Nights”,”Hey Brothers”……etc. Avicii’s music is not only just music, it tells us the life story of the musician. He presents his true spirit through his music and tells his philosophy of life through the lyrics, every song he has released is a part of his life story! Sadly, this talented musician suicided on April 20, 2018. He was only 28 when he passed away."
"“Lucky the few whom we or those opposite have been able to inter with some sort of decency—for fragments of human bodies are still hanging in the barbed wire.”, written in the letter of Hugo Müller, a 23-year-old German soldier serving on the Western Front, “now they are all lying dead and hardly even buried between the trenches, while over them bullets and shells sing their gruesome dirge.” Living in such an uncomfortable and unsanitized environment imposed a heavy psychological burden on the soldiers: all they can see are mud and rats gnawing on dismantled body parts, all they can hear are roars of artilleries and moans of their crippled comrades, all they can smell are the putrid stench of rotting carcasses and festering wounds. “Ghastly! The man who could never shudder and shake would learn how here!” exclaimed Müller; the experience was straight up maddening, in fact, some soldiers did go mad and succumbed to the shell shock “Anybody who allowed himself to realize the whole tragedy of some of the daily occurrences in our life here would either lose his reason or be forced to bolt across to the enemy's trench with his arms high in the air.”"
"Entrepreneurial capitalists of the New South extended the business of agriculture beyond the old plantations and into regions of small farms. There was an acute shortage of capital in the south, which posed major obstacles to rebuilding the economy. The prosperous economic development of the west symbolized that the Whites’ control over territory had finally spread across the whole continent. The frontier had represented a sort of escape mechanism for Americans. With the frontier gone, the possibility of escape into the wilderness to create a new life and even a new identity was gone as well, and people felt as though their power to shape their lives had diminished. Most of the settlers on the frontier moved from eastern farms or older frontiers. Of city dwellers, the frontier lured the young, the restless, and the adventurous who wanted to live “the American Dream” of complete freedom and a natural way of life. However, with the closure of the Frontier, the dream seemed to die with the people permanently."
"On the other hand, though still an unpleasant experience, the military lives of Napoleonic soldiers were much less suffocating than those of WWI combatants. Unlike the stalemate of trench warfare, the Napoleonic soldiers were always in motion. Either advancing or retreating, they constantly engaged in open field battles and utilized cavalry charge, a tactic rendered useless due to barbed wire and precise artillery strikes during WWI. Instead of being cooped up in a hellhole 24 hours a day, trauma-inducing events are occasional occurrences for the Napoleonic soldiers. “Napoleon, calling the artillery of his Guard, ordered it to fire cannonballs onto the ice”, excerpted from the memoir of Jean Baptiste Antione Marcelin Marbot, an old French soldier who fought in the Battle of Austerlitz, “We saw thousands of Russians, horses, cannons, and wagons, slowly sink into the abyss!...A horribly majestic spectacle I will never forget!” The PTSD of Napoleonic soldiers was of much smaller magnitude and was mostly related to the harsh winter of Russia, in comparison to the man-made horror WWI soldiers needed to face everyday, the lives of Napoleonic troopers were ironically a lot more “healthier”."
"“If I can’t become the best in others’ fields, then why don’t I create my own field?” The thought flashed through my brain as self introduction ended. I realized that I could never become what I really wanted if I kept chasing after people in their profession. I needed to find my own path and create my own unique value. After a long search for identity, I found my passion in game design. I combined my love of video games and fiction with my skills in coding and animation, and finally found a unique specialty of myself. On the other hand, I didn’t give up the things I learned during my search, because I knew that everything I learned will help me someday. I continued my lessons in drumming, hoping I will be as good as my friends one day and join their band."
"I pulled him behind one of the few intact huts remaining. “Father,” I growled, “I think you would agree that peace between the Whites and us is impossible. You remember what the general was willing to do if we retreated — we would be executed on the spot! You see what kind of evil they are capable of! No matter what we do and how much we appease them, someday we’re going to suffer the same fate as the Red Sticks. Maybe…” I swallowed, the taste of rotting earth and mulch still lingering on my tongue. “Maybe the Red Sticks were right. Fighting back is our only option.” My father stared at me, the customary blaze returning to his eyes, and I wondered if I had gone too far. From behind his back, he produced two scarlet war clubs, presumably taken without the Whites noticing. He handed one to me and I grasped it with both hands, the handle fitting snugly in my grip."
"Modern weaponry was not the only cause for this tremendous amount of death, a gun needs to be fired upon someone to create a casualty, the mass mobilization was the second pillar that contributed to the absurdly high death toll. Europe in the 1900s experienced only a three fold increase of population compared to that of 1780s, what truly enabled the eleven times casualty is the quick and large-scale mobilization brought about by the advance of transportation technologies. Railroad enabled military planners to move large numbers of men quickly to precise locations; millions of men boarded the steel boxcar to be hauled to different war zones where they faced an almost certain death. In addition, mass mobilization was not limited to Europe. With the invention of the steamboat, colonial troops all across the globe were dragged into this European hellscape to fight a war that was not even theirs."
"“A student’s only job is to study,” is what I had been told while growing up in Taiwan. Like Ryan, I often buried myself in books without a real purpose. I felt stuck in the endless cycle of tests, so I decided to change. My friends and I founded an organization called GenZ Student Society, with the goal of promoting intrinsic motivation for learning by encouraging students to find their passion and create their own future. To reach out and promote our beliefs to people, I initiated and led a team to build an interactive website for GenZ. We gathered thirty students that had similar motivations from schools across the country and held a TEDx event where we promoted making proactiveness a lifestyle. My friends and I weren’t fully satisfied after the TEDx event, so we started a podcast, The Z Idea to reach more students. I let Ryan listen to our podcast at the end of last semester."
"We all know that Zeus is the king of the gods in Greek mythology, also the lord of the sky and thunder. So basically, nearly every being in Greek mythology, including other gods, were supposed to serve Zeus. However, there are some beings who existed only to serve Zeus. The four vanguard of Zeus are Nike, Kratos, Zelos, and Bia. What Nike is most famous for is probably its shoes, but today we are not talking about that Nike. Nike is the goddess of victory, which also refers to her Roman name, Victoria. She not only symbolizes the victory in war, but all competition, including sports and competitive eating. Nike was also Zeus’s personal charioteer. Nike is highly related to Athena, in some tales she was even an avatar of Athena, this is because after victory at the Battle of Marathon, Athenians erected the Nike of Callimachus."
"Though both fueled by nationalistic belief, the experience of a soldier who served in World War I differed from that of a Napoleonic Wars soldier due to the revolutionizing weaponry, trench tactic, and mass mobilization made possible by transportation innovation. Unlike the musket-wielding, horse-riding French infantry who went on a 20-years-long conquest of Europe domination, WWI soldiers were quickly gathered up and sent to the trenches, where they were stuck in the sludgy ditches and given the instruments of war capable of unleashing hell on earth. Wars had always been traumatic, yet nothing compared to the horrors of WWI until WWII came along. The winter in Russia did give a considerable amount of Napoleonic soldiers nightmares; however, the mental trauma of WWI soldiers was so severe and prevalent that people even invented a new term for this nightmare: “shell shock”. As its name suggested, World War I was a war that got the whole world involved into an unprecedented extreme conflict, the greatest war in which a single Battle of Verdun alone rivaled the total casualties of the entire series of  Napoleonic Wars."
"The first one is the boy around his age, a roommate called Stradlater. Stradlater is a narcissist who thinks he is the most handsome boy around, and he uses his appearance to seduce girls. Every time Holden hears him complimenting his current girlfriend, the next day he is dating another girl. Holden noted that Stradlader had ugly behaviors, such as using a rusty razor that he never cleansed once and having really stinky underwear. Holden concluded that he is a bastard who pretends to look glamorous outside, but totally rotten inside. Holden had a fight with Stradlader when he heard that he had a date with his childhood crush, he just couldn’t stand imagining the scene of Stradlader flirting with his neighbor, who obviously didn’t know Stradlader well. The second kind of phony is Mr.Spencer, Holden’s history teacher. Holden described the old man as a depressing pile of bones. Mr.Spencer was like the typical teaching authority, he urged Holden to grow up, to be a mature man; he told Holden that Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.”, yet the old man never tried to understand the motives behind Holden’s actions. The old man just had a simple mindset of “I endured it and made it, why can’t you?” and force Holden to accept it."
"Standing beside veterinarians during out-patient clinics and offering assistance, I got a clear picture of veterinary Standard Operating Procedures. The veterinarian showed me from simple treats such as calming down the animals, removing parasites, packaging medicine, to some surgical techniques like amputation, electro-coagulation, and surgical suturing. Once, they even brought me to the patients’ home to practice euthanasia on an old collie. I watched the veterinarian sternly and carefully injected three syringes into the collie’s forelimb, with the collie’s family sobbing, and me gently stroking its back. This internship not only enriched me intellectually but also spiritually. Watching the vets being bitten and scratched while curing the animals, I learned from their great patience and willingness of self-sacrifice. Through the practice of euthanasia, I understood the duty of a veterinarian is beyond keeping our best friends healthy and happy, aiming for the complete dignity of animals’ lives that we owe. After this internship, my chest is swollen with respect for veterinarians, and I am more certain than ever that I want to follow their paths."
"Throughout Sommer’s articles, the most commonly utilized form of forwarding is illustrating, which she regularly recounts in reminiscence of her childhood and her career as a writer. After the tale of Struvelpater, she continued to explain that not only she, but her whole family as well, are victims of authority. Sommers brought up two childhood anecdotes to show how authority narrowed her parents’ perspective and patternized their behavior. The first incident occurred during the family trip to the Grand Canyon, as her mother treated the AAA tour guide as bible and governed the entire journey with mere papers with words. Sommers felt that what she saw wasn't her own view, but the imagery depicted by the guide book instead; she was a prisoner of the tour guide, having neither freedom nor authority outside the area defined by the book. The second event was Sommers experience of learning her ancestral tongue as an eight-year-old child. Sommers’ father would rather she and her brother learn German through official language learning tape instead of teaching them himself; despite being a German by birth and spoke fluent German. "
"In the digital era, cybersecurity has become a paramount concern for individuals and organizations alike. The recent surge in cyber attacks highlights the vulnerability of digital infrastructure and the need for robust security measures. Cybersecurity strategies now prioritize not only the protection of sensitive information but also the resilience of systems to ensure continuity in the face of threats. Advances in encryption technology and the development of more sophisticated firewalls have been critical in defending against hackers. However, the human element remains the weakest link, with social engineering attacks exploiting human psychology rather than technical flaws. Education and awareness programs have thus become essential components of comprehensive cybersecurity plans, aiming to equip people with the knowledge to recognize and resist phishing attempts and other deceptive practices."
"In the 1980s, neuroscientists studying the brain processes underlying our sense of consciousness compared subjects’ judgments regarding their subjective will to move (W) and actual movement (M) with objective electroencephalographic activity called readiness potential, or RP. As expected, W preceded M: subjects consciously perceived the intention to move as preceding a conscious experience of actually moving. This might seem to suggest an appropriate correspondence between the sequence of subjective experiences and the sequence of the underlying events in the brain. But researchers actually found a surprising temporal relation between subjective experience and objectively measured neural events: in direct contradiction of the classical conception of free will, neural preparation to move (RP) preceded conscious awareness of the intention to move (W) by hundreds of milliseconds."
"Historians frequently employ probate inventories — lists of possessions compiled after a person’s death — to estimate standard of living. Because these inventories were taken by amateur assessors according to unwritten rules, they are sometimes unreliable. One way to check their accuracy is to compare them to archaeological records. A study of records from the state of Delaware in the eighteenth century found that while very few inventories listed earthenware, every excavation contained earthenware. Earthenware may have gone unlisted simply because it was inexpensive. But if it was so commonplace, why was it listed more often for wealthy households? Perhaps the more earthenware people had, the more likely appraisers were to note it. A few bowls could easily be absorbed into another category, but a roomful of earthenware could not."
"You may have heard that tomatoes and processed tomato products like tomato sauce and canned tomatoes protect against some types of cancer. The cancer-preventing properties of tomato products have been attributed to lycopene. It is a bright red pigment found in tomatoes and other red fruits and is the cause of their red color. Unlike other fruits and vegetables, where nutritional content such as vitamin C is diminished upon cooking, processing of tomatoes increases the concentration of lycopene. Lycopene in tomato paste is four times more than in fresh tomatoes. This is because lycopene is insoluble in water and is tightly bound to vegetable fiber. Thus, processed tomato products such as pasteurized tomato juice, so up, sauce, and ketchup contain the highest concentrations of lycopene. Cooking and crushing tomatoes as in the canning process and serving in oil-rich dishes such as spaghetti sauce or pizza greatly increase assimilation from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. Lycopene is a fat-soluble substance, so the oil is said to help absorption to a great extent."
"The grey wolf also known as the timber wolf or wolf is a mammal of the order Carnivore. Genetic studies indicate the grey wolf shares a common ancestry with the domestic dog and might be its ancestor. Many other grey wolf subspecies have been identified however the actual number of subspecies is still open to discussion. Though once abundant over much of North America and areas of Europe and Asia, the grey wolf inhabits a very small portion of its former range because of the widespread destruction of its habitat. Gray wolves are highly adaptable and have thrived in forests, deserts, mountains, tundra and grasslands. They function as social predators and hunt in packs organized according to strict social hierarchies. It was originally believed that this comparatively high level of social organization was related to hunting success, and while this still may be true to a certain extent, emerging theories suggest that the pack has less to do with hunting and more to do with reproductive success."
"The Anti-Corruption Foundation, or the FBK is a non-profit organization established in Moscow in 2011. Its main goal is to investigate and to expose corruption among high-ranking Russian government officials. Under the main goals are four major topics-- end corruption, end privilege, end censorship and end Putin. A FBK member Ruslan Shaveddinov was captured and sent to a remote Arctic military base. On December 23th 2019, Ruslan was dragged out of his own apartment, seized and taken to a military base in Novaya Zemlya archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, which is 2000 km away from his home in Moscow. However, according to Navalny, Ruslan was able to contact him with a borrowed phone and told him about his condition. Ruslan said that he was under the supervision of at least one officer at a time, 23 hours a day, even when he was in the toilet. The soldiers permitted him to walk around the base if he wished, yet it was -27°C outside and he wasn’t given any winter clothing."
"From a professional viewpoint, graduating from foreign universities is often a gateway to a successful career. The connection is direct and provides strong motivation for young people to study abroad. The hope is that such graduates have an added advantage over their peers in a highly competitive job market. In some cases, top students from prestigious universities land job offers even before completing their studies. Furthermore, well-known corporations vie to attract the fresh new talent, who will help achieve corporate profitability in the future. From a personal angle, studying abroad enables young people to mature quickly and develop independence. For instance, joining a foreign academic institution is often the first experience students have of living away from parents, siblings and friends. In one's home country, this strong nexus provides support, assistance and guidance. However, while abroad, students must overcome the initial homesickness and culture shock, conform to a different teaching style, adapt to unfamiliar social and cultural expectations and develop proficiency in a new language. These challenging tasks enable youngsters to emerge with greater maturity and self-confidence."
"It’s all because of a misunderstanding. Most people believe that wearing bras can prevent mastoptosis, which means drooping breasts; however, this is not the case. “Medically, physiologically, anatomically, the breast does not benefit from being deprived of gravity,” Jean-Denis Rouillon, a professor at the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon stated. Bras do not support our breasts and tight bras can even cause various kinds of pain (such as neck, rib cage, and back pain). Furthermore, wearing bras provides no benefits for our breasts and even restricts our circulation. While wearing tight bras, it prevents the blood from flowing through our chest and cuts off our circulation which would cause numbness, muscle cramps, and tingling. Also, it’s not hygienic for girls to wear their bras for the whole day. ""The dirt and sweat that build-up underneath [your bra] can lead to skin infections and acne,"" claims Dr. Seshadri, who graduated from SUNY Buffalo with a chief resident. During summer, while the sun shines directly above our heads, our sweat stuck on our bras for the whole day! It is not only dirty but it would also cause eczema."
"Dressing up oneself is a social skill we need to hold as we step into society. Imagine yourself at your first Christmas party in college: your crush and all your friends are wearing exquisite makeup and fancy suits, making them look like the leading characters of the night. Now then, look at yourself: you are still wearing your mother’s outdated tuxedo, which you did not have a chance to buy one for yourself; the styling you thought might work out was awkward, which it could not be esteemed as your styling but simulated from someone else. This is all because your high school stipulated what you wear everyday. When talking about “casual clothings”, what you can think of is uniform, uniform, and uniform. This habit was formed when your school told you to wear uniforms when there is any casual circumstance we need to participate in. This seems terrible, huh? If we have the opportunity to hold the skill of dressing ourselves, wouldn’t our college life, or our life stepping into society become more light-hearted and confident? High school is a period of transformation for us before stepping into society, knowledge is truly important, but aren’t social skills what  all people need to acquire? The skill to dress up oneself is really important, why should the school restrict students to learn about it? "
"Moreover, Ruslan was said to have a valid medical excuse that exempts him from military service. In response to Navalny's statement, Moscow’s military enlistment office claimed that Ruslan is treated just like other soldiers and president Putin expressed condolences for the attack on Navalny’s office. The factuality of Ruslan’s condition is still a subject of debate, but the Russian people are on FBK’s side. “Happy New Year 1937”, said one placard, referring to the peak year of Stalin-era purges. “Ruslan Shaveddinov has been kidnapped and exiled to Novaya Zemlya,” said the sign, according to photographs released by Navalny’s allies. To this day, Ruslan Shaveddinov remains in the Arctic camp and his fate remains to be decided. While Russian politics might be corrupt, their struggle for influence is still easily visible. Now, we are leaving Moscow and going East to Siberia. Earlier in 2019, Russian gas company Gazprom launched a new pipeline that supplies natural gas from the Russian Far East to China. This is a part of the project called the Power of Siberia, which involves building pipelines that reach all the way south toward Shanghai in China. This current pipeline stretches over 3000 kilometers from the gas fields in Siberia to Heihe in China’s Heilongjiang province. However, the actual significance of this pipeline lies in the reason why it is built."
"A world without sarcasm is a dull and bitter one. Sarcasm provides an extra option for people to communicate with each other in daily conversations. The casual use of sarcasm makes the conversation more interesting and relaxing. “Nice shoes,” says your classmate, while you are wearing a pair of smelly slippers. You immediately realize that you are wearing the wrong shoes and rush back home to get the proper sneakers. “Your room looks tidy,” says your mom when she sees your messy room with dirty socks hanging everywhere. You knew that you better clean your room right away or you will face a severe spanking on the buttocks. Instead of saying “It’s Monday, moron” or “Your room looks disgusting”, the use of sarcasm eases the conversation and creates a more relaxing atmosphere. People will feel a sense of mellowness as their mistakes were corrected in the form of a joke rather than an acrid criticism, giving them a back door to escape from embarrassment. The subtle use of a “true lie” allows people to get your insincerity and correct or revise themselves. Through sarcasm, our society gradually improves as people are constantly hinting at each other’s flaws. Sarcasm, indeed, makes modern society a better place."
"Russian President Putin and Chinese leader Xi oversaw the launch of a pipeline from Russia to China. This act strengthens the political and economic relations between China and Russia. In earlier years, Russia suffered economic sanctions from the West after annexing Crimea, and its economy suffered as a result. This pipeline opens up a new market for one of Russia’s top exports -- natural gas. This pipeline runs from the Chayandinskoye and Kovykta fields in eastern Siberia, through Heilongjiang and Jilin to Liaoning. The gas is produced by the Russian state-owned company Gazprom, which is a major source of income for the Russian government. The pipeline is projected to ship 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year by the year 2025, which would make China the second-largest consumer of Russian gas after Germany at 58.5 billion cubic meters in 2019. This is also a response to American efforts at reducing the reliance on Russia natural gas in Western Europe by shipping liquified natural gas to these countries. "
"At the age of 15, Hitchcock experienced WWI, which is a war that pushed the boy onto the road of filmography. Hitchcock was too young to enlist when the war broke out, and when he did three years later, he received a C3 certification and became one of the Royal Engineers in the army. The experience of working in the army shattered Hitchcock’s engineer dream, the sights of destruction and overloaded work consumed his passion bit by bit; finally, Hitchcock lost interest in engineering and quit the school after the war. After giving up on engineering, Hitchcock found himself interested in creative writing. He got a job in a company called Henley Telegraph, where he started off as an editor. Hitchcock’s talent in writing soon caught his boss' attention and got promoted to the advertising department; writing short stories and drawing graphics in Henley’s was his ""first step toward cinema"", he loved the job so much that he stayed in the office. Besides working in Henley’s, Hitchcock also loves watching movies on weekends: he watched Chaplin’s The Kid, D. W. Griffith’s Orphans of the Storm, and probably one of his favorites, Fritz Lang's Der müde Tod."
"Pirates are often depicted  as infamous outlaws that roam and plunder the sea; however, many were actually mercenaries working for one nation to attack the ships of another. Privateers, originally called buccaneers, were a group of men abandoned by  society, like runaway African slaves, escaped criminals, or even defectors. These people formed a large number of buccaneering communities on the islands of Central America, and tried to make a living by fishing, gathering, and trading. The nomads soon drew the attention of European countries such as Spain and Portugal, who  tried to force the buccaneers off their promised land by cutting off  their food supplies; yet this movement backfired as the communities had no choice but to start committing  sea robbery in order to stay alive. Piracy eventually ran wild as the buccaneers found profit in it, but mere pirates didn’t stand a chance against the mighty navy of Spain, and it was the time that Britain got involved in the region. The English government hired the buccaneers as mercenaries to ransack Spanish cargo ships; and in exchange for their labor, the British offered them the support of legal authority, which were permission and equipment."
"Before the sanctions, much of Russia’s exports are petroleum based products such as crude oil and natural gas, and Europe was its main importer. As such, the value of its exports are very sensitive to the unpredictable swings in oil prices through time. Due to advancements in shale oil drilling in the US increasing supply, the price of oil and related products crashed in 2014, ending at less than half the price compared to the start of the year. Much lower prices like this means that Russian oil companies can no longer profit as much from their products, decreasing their revenues. However, in Europe, natural gas is widely used in cold areas for home heating during the winter. Under the sanctions, Europe will no longer be able to meet this demand. To solve this problem, the US started shipping liquefied natural gases on ships in an effort to reduce Europe’s reliance on Russian gas. The US Department of Energy refers to the exported gas as “freedom gas,” as it frees European countries from Russian control."
"Compared to Hepburn’s glorious career as an actress, her childhood was relatively challenging. Born in Brussels, Belgium on May 4th, 1929, she inherited the English temperament from her father, Joseph Victor Anthony Hepburn-Ruston, an English businessman, and royal blood from her mother, Ella van Heemstra, a Dutch baroness. She had two half brothers, Alexander and Ian, who were born in her mother’s previous marriage with a Dutch noble. After her parents divorced, she moved back to Arnhem, Netherlands with her mother. When the Nazis took over her town in 1940, they cut off all the food supplies so that she had to eat tulips filled with water to stay alive. As a result, she suffered from depression and malnutrition that sculpted her slender body shape in adulthood. Her parent’s avid support for the Fascist party also shamed Hepburn with guilt and stress. Fortunately, she wasn’t influenced by her family’s racial perspective. Instead, she followed her own moral standard and maintained her passion to help others. During her teenage years, Hepburn became a trained nurse for the Allies in WWII. She also danced ballet in the so-called “black-out performances” to raise funds secretly for the Dutch rebel’s fight against Hitler’s regime. That was the time she developed her interest in performing."
"With all his talented work, he was invited to become one of the members in Military Intelligence, Section 6 where all the top-secret of Britain are stored. At the age of 27, Alan Turing became the leader of participants in the breaking of German ciphers -Enigma. With Turing’s talent and hard work, he and his team created a machine called “the bombe” which is an electromechanical device that became the primary tool to break the German’s enciphered messages. Later on, he even joined Hut 8 which focused on cracking German naval Enigma codes. The Naval Enigma was the most complicated system that no one tried to solve. However, Turing said that “because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself.” As expected, Turing succeeded in solving the most essential part of the system. There is no doubt that Turing's work was the biggest factor that caused the Hut 8's success, but he also shared his honor with his partners for the invention of the bombe. Some historians and scientists had estimated the contribution that he made during WWII. They believed that he had shortened at least two years of the war and saved thousands and millions of people’s lives."
"But the love of beauty is human nature. People seek for opportunities to lead oneself into a more attractive role. Take our school as an example, we are limited from wearing our own clothes at school. But we then wear earrings, necklaces, or fashion shoes in an attempt to make ourselves more gorgeous. Even though we have no choice to decide on our outfit, we still spend quite an amount of time on determining what to wear everyday. The desire to dress up oneself is stronger than one could imagine. Restricting the students from their wearing actually doesn’t help abbreviate the time spent on making oneself more adorable.With no effectiveness occurring by restricting one’s wearing, there is no reason for a student not being able to decide on what to wear to schools. Wearing one’s own clothes is really important for a student. Not saying that it is a good way to speak for oneself, knowing how to dress up oneself is also a skill you will need when you grow up, meaning that school absolutely should give students the right to decide on what to wear everyday."
"Ernest Hemingway once said, “Every man’s life ends the same way. It is the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another.” As one of the most famous American writers, Hemingway lived an extraordinary life and recorded his experiences in his various works. From personal experiences to true war accounts, Hemingway left his readers with works that reflected reality. Although Hemingway only lived a life of 61 years, his legacy continued to impact both his readers and fellow writers. Throughout his childhood, Hemingway lived with his family in Oak Park, Illinois, and went to public schools, where he discovered his talent for writing. Born in a suburb of Chicago on July 21, 1899, Hemingway was the first of the five children of Clarence Hemingway, a doctor, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician. During his childhood, Hemingway used to spend his summers on Walloon Lake in Michigan with his family, where he developed a passion for outdoor activities. He began writing in high school and participated in the production of his school newspaper, Trapeze and Tabula, whose content was mainly about sports. After graduating from high school, he decided not to go to college. Instead, Hemingway officially started his writing career by traveling to Kansas City to become a reporter."
"During the election, Zelensky avoided using traditional campaign tactics and talked little about his policies if he became the president. Instead, he used his charisma to post online videos or stand up comedy gigs and jokes. Analysts believe that it was Zelensky’s special style and his vow to stamp out corruption that met with Ukranian’s expectations. Moreover, Zelensky’s campaign blurred the lines between the real Zelenskiy and his persona on TV. They built him like the fictional president of his television series, where he promised to clean up politics and end the stranglehold of the oligarchy over Ukraine. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about his close links to the controversial oligarch Ihor Kolomoyskyi. Although he denied after Poroshenko called him a “Kolomoyskyi puppet”, many members of Zelenskiy’s campaign team clearly have links to the oligarch. Also, critics have expressed doubts if he would be able to lead the country and stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. After the election, many leaders around the world congratulated Zelensky on his win. French President Emmanuel Macron and Poland's President Andrzej Duda congratulated Mr Zelensky in a phone call.  UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt tweeted: ""You will now truly be the Servant of the People."" "
"I met my brother on my sister’s wedding day in 2021, the first time I met her too. The next time I saw him was this summer as we watched his cold body get lowered precariously into the ground on a steep hillside in Oklahoma. It was the kind of hot day where nothing you do will stop you from sweating. As a group of men, including another brother of mine, struggled with his casket over the recently dug hole, I heard his wife morbidly joke, “haven’t you all done this before?”. I stood next to my late brother’s estranged oldest daughter, my technical niece I am trying to know, and my sister being comforted by her husband. The anger was palpable from his daughter he left behind and the sorrow overflowing from our sister – I was somewhere in between. Angry and terribly sad that I hardly knew him. It didn’t need to be this way yet this is what the fertility world carefully created and designed. I was not supposed to know him or any of them. I was not supposed to want to."
"The cottonwoods and locusts then take the lead, bright yellow and fluttery orange waving, then dancing down on the omnipresent wind. The cottonwoods stayed on schedule, but the locust trees waited, joining the others in a late turn and shed. Come Halloween, the first flush of color developed on the Bradford pears, a few carefully nursed maples, the red oaks, and the locusts. By this past week, the entire city boasted crimsons and purple-red, dark brown to pale brown to beautiful green-yellow that glowed in the sun. Magnolias and a few others remained green, adding a contrast that pleased the eye. The wind added sound, whispering and hissing among the dying leaves, then taking a few as dance partners, twirling and skating them down to the ground. Passing cars tossed them back into the air to settle once more. The temperature proclaimed late summer, but the eyes declared autumn, as did the early evenings and longer nights. Slanted southern light turned red and orange leaves into glowing jewels against a mild blue sky. Hints of wood smoke, more from smokers than fireplaces, teased of the turning of the year. Winter will come soon, and true cold, and perhaps cold rain that will drag the last color off the trees."
"Pesto alla genovese is one of those ingredients that is much better when made at home, even if you use a blender instead of a mortar and pestle. There are two reasons for this. First, almost all store-bought pesto contains incorrect ingredients: pine nuts are replaced with cashews, extra virgin olive oil with sunflower or canola oil, Parmigiano Reggiano with other cheeses, and sometimes even some of the basil is substituted with spinach or parsley. Second, the flavor of homemade pesto is fresher, brighter, and more complex. And if you have a blender, it’s not a lot of work. The most time-consuming part is stripping the basil leaves from the stems. Making homemade lasagna is a lot of work, especially if you prepare fresh pasta dough, but it’s absolutely worth it. Most people are familiar with lasagne alla bolognese, but one of my favorites is lasagne alla genovese. Both dishes feature the most iconic recipe from their respective hometowns: ragù alla bolognese from Bologna, and pesto alla genovese from Genoa. In the Genovese version, the pesto is mixed with béchamel, and the lasagna is layered with grilled zucchini or green beans, sometimes with the addition of boiled potatoes."
"Was it the start of blogging? Technically, no. People were hand-coding HTML diaries to the soundtrack of dial-up long before 2001. But Valdrighi did something quietly important: he helped democratise it for anyone with a cheap shared host and a bit of curiosity. With b2/cafelog, you did not need to wrestle with raw HTML every time you wanted to post. You logged in, wrote, clicked publish. Was it the start of “posting”? In a small way, yes. Before infinite scroll and algorithmic feeds, there was the simple, chronological rhythm of the cafelog. It was one of the early ancestors of the modern “feed”, but with fewer distractions and a lot more intention. But the real spark was something bigger. Michel Valdrighi did not just create a way to write; he helped show how powerful open code can be in the real world. By choosing the GPL license, he showed that code does not have to be guarded to matter. Shared code can travel farther and live longer."
"“Cafelog” didn’t sound like enterprise software; it sounded like a digital notebook kept by someone in a café, sipping espresso and sending thoughts into the ether. It was not built for dashboards, pipelines, or approval workflows. It was built for expression. For publishing. For having a place where your words could live. For a slice of the early web, it felt small, elegant, and cool, and it quietly became the blogging tool of choice for many early adopters. But then Michel did the thing every developer sometimes has to do, and every user quietly worries about: he stepped away. Around 2002, the updates slowed and then stopped. Emails piled up. Life moved on, and the creator went quiet for a while. In a world of closed, proprietary software, that is often where the story ends. If the people with access to the source code leave, the product freezes in time and eventually fades away."
"There are already many things that could be improved by a declining birth rate. Teacher-student ratios would improve. Homeless people would be better able to find safe places to live. Unemployed people would be better able to find jobs. Per capita food production would increase. Per-capita access to fresh water would increase. Carbon emissions would decrease. More resources could be focused on improving existing infrastructure instead of expanding to accommodate more people. At some point in the future, most people will want the population to decrease. Before that happens, we should find a way to end our dependence on population growth. I don't know what the solution is. I think that whoever finds it should win a Nobel prize in economics. We just need to get to a point where nobody needs to worry about the negative impacts of a falling birth rate."
"Now that I’m in my 20s, I’m starting to see adulthood for what it actually is - not the freedom and independence we were taught to expect, but a system that feels like it’s already claimed huge pieces of our lives before we even start living them. You work hard and finally begin earning real money, and before it reaches your hands, a significant portion is already taken (income tax). You accept that because “that’s how it is.” Then you go to spend what’s left on basic things - groceries, transportation, necessities - and there’s another layer taken from you (sales tax). If you ever manage to save enough to think about owning something, you discover that ownership isn’t really ownership at all. You keep paying year after year just to hold on to what you supposedly worked for (property tax). And the more I pay attention, the more frustrated I get. Not in a reckless way but in that unsettling, eye-opening way where you realize the structure around you was never designed for people to truly get ahead. At least not in the way we were told."
"I keep hearing stories from every woman I know about how their serious pain (especially with things like endometriosis) was dismissed for years as ""just cramps"" or ""anxiety."" Most are told that they need to lose weight before any of their issues can be addressed. This seems to be a near-universal experience, whether in the US or single-payer systems. It takes an average of almost 7 years to get a diagnosis of endometriosis. To the clinicians out there: Are you taught to recognize this bias? Are you aware of this reputation your field has? And are you worried that it pushes people who feel unheard toward alternative medicine or even quackery? Why not just treat a person who says they have endometriosis? I'm genuinely trying to understand the insider's perspective on this."
"This is a question I've wondered for a long time. Can an abuser ever be actually redeemed? To me, I think the answer is no. No matter what they do in the future, there will always be pain and blood on their hands that they can never undo. Abuse is always a choice, so they could have just chosen to be good at any time and didn't. Research has shown that mental illness and addiction make someone more likely to be a victim than an abuser, so those factors should make people LESS likely to abuse. If the victim chooses not to forgive, then it is unforgivable because the victim is the one who truly matters in the situation. To me, it's like, even if a murderer never kills someone again, they will always be a murderer. They can live the rest of their lives never hurting another person and they will always be a murderer. I say this because I am an abuser. I hurt someone horribly emotionally and verbally, I cyberstalked her with fake accounts to try to get close to her again, and I tracked down her irl family when she told me my actions made her suicidal. She said I am unforgivable, and that is very much her right. I am unforgivable and irredeemable."
"I’ve been noticing a shift inside me. A quiet one, but strong enough that I can’t ignore it. I’ve been thinking more about my direction, my values, and what kind of person I’m becoming. And while I’m changing on the inside, some of the people around me feel unchanged staying in the same routines, the same conversations, the same stories we’ve repeated for years. I don’t think they’re wrong for it. But the distance between us is getting harder to hide. While I’m trying to understand myself more honestly, my old friends are focused on work, entertainment, dating, the things that used to feel normal to me too. Now they feel like echoes from a life that doesn’t fit anymore. There’s no superiority in this. It’s just that we’re not on the same stage anymore. And the hardest part is realizing I knew this long before I admitted it. I stayed because it felt easier than letting go. I told myself it was loyalty. But in truth, I was afraid to outgrow the people who once felt like home."
"The concept of personal responsibility is often heralded as a cornerstone of a functioning society. However, its interpretation can vary widely, influencing everything from policy-making to individual behavior. On one hand, a strong emphasis on personal responsibility can empower individuals to take control of their lives, fostering self-discipline and initiative. On the other hand, it can lead to the absolution of systemic issues that contribute to inequality and disadvantage. For instance, when society places the burden of success solely on individuals, it may overlook the structural barriers that impede certain groups. This raises critical questions: How do we balance personal responsibility with the need for collective action? Can a society that prioritizes individual freedoms still ensure equity for all its members? As we navigate these complex dynamics, what role should education and community support play in fostering a more inclusive understanding of personal responsibility? I invite your thoughts on how we can redefine this concept to promote both individual agency and social progress."
"Organ donation is the one part of modern medicine that cannot be scaled on demand. You can increase funding, hire more surgeons, expand hospital capacity, and build new technology, but you cannot manufacture human organs whenever you want. The entire system depends on people choosing to donate. Because of that, I believe that if someone is medically capable of being an organ donor after death but chooses not to, they should not be allowed to receive donated human organs themselves. This is not about punishing anyone. It is about fairness and sustainability. A system that relies on voluntary contribution cannot survive if too many people take from it while refusing to give anything back. That is exactly what happens when someone refuses to be a donor yet still expects full access to donor organs. They become free riders. The system works only because other people are willing to donate. Opting out while still expecting to benefit is the definition of unfair."
"Organ donation involves no personal sacrifice once you are gone. There is no pain, no medical risk, and nothing required of you while alive. Meanwhile the person waiting for a transplant is running out of time. Human organs are the most limited medical resource on earth. Every available organ literally decides who lives and who dies. If someone refuses to contribute to the pool that saves lives, it does not make sense for them to receive equal access to it. Now, here is what makes this viewpoint even more reasonable. We are entering a point in medicine where there are alternatives to human donor organs. Lab grown organs are becoming more viable each year. Scientists are already creating functional tissues and early stage organs using stem cells and bioprinting. Xenotransplantation from animals is also progressing rapidly. Genetically edited pig organs are already being transplanted experimentally and will eventually become a mainstream option."
"These alternatives exist for people who do not want to participate in the human donor system. If someone refuses to be a donor, they should be directed toward these scientific or animal based organs instead of taking a human organ that came from someone who was willing to give. That preserves the fairness of the human donor pool and still provides a path to treatment for the person who opted out. What makes this important is the simple reality that every human donor organ is a once in a lifetime chance for someone. If a donated heart or kidney goes to one person, another person does not get that chance. Giving that organ to someone who refused to donate undermines the entire system because it rewards someone who did not contribute while potentially costing a willing donor their opportunity to live. People often say it is their body and their choice. That is absolutely true. You have every right not to donate. But if you choose not to be part of the system that saves lives, then the system should not be obligated to give you its most limited resource. You still deserve treatment, and modern science will continue to offer more options. But you should not receive the benefit that comes entirely from the generosity of others if you refuse to be part of that generosity yourself."
"Obviously, the field of sex work is not an innocent one. There’s plenty of risks that need to be considered. Personally, I do not care about the legality of prostitution - it’s not relevant to me. When I was diving down a wikipedia rabbit hole earlier, however, I realized that I don’t really get why sex work is illegal in the United States. None of the reasons I found from a google search convinced me, so I decided to come here. To present my point - prostitution should be legal. So long as both parties are fully consenting adults, I don’t see how it’s different from any other business. It’s a monetary exchange for a service - a service which is perfectly legal by itself (again, assuming consent from both parties). I don’t see why it shouldn’t be legal. Religion shouldn’t influence laws. STI concerns could be alleviated through proper use of protection - perhaps use could be mandated. Concerns regarding sexual exploitation are completely understandable, but exploitation and prostitution do not have to go together. Exploitation is a separate issue. Moreover, pornography is legally protected, provided it’s consensual - if pornography is fine, why isn’t prostitution?"
"I am in my early 30s and when people ask about my plans I usually say something like ""I just want a stable job I do not hate, a small place that feels safe, some hobbies and time with people I like."" Every time I say that, someone responds with a little speech about how I am ""selling myself short"" or ""wasting my potential"". It feels like there is an unspoken rule that you must chase something huge or dramatic or your life does not count. To be clear, I am not against ambition. If someone wants to be a founder, climb a crazy career ladder or travel constantly, that is great. What bothers me is the assumption that a quiet life is automatically a consolation prize. Social media and self help content push the idea that if you are not constantly leveling up you are stagnating. But an ordinary day where you work, cook dinner, read a book and go to bed on time can still be meaningful. It is just not flashy. I think this pressure hurts people. Some friends feel like failures even though they are good parents, kind partners, and solid coworkers, because they do not have a big ""story"" to tell at parties. Others jump into intense goals they do not really want, burn out, then feel worse. It seems more honest and healthier to let ""I want a simple, steady life"" be a respected choice."
"The character Vivian, from the game Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, deserves to be a playable character in Mario Kart, (and in every other Mario spinoff as well). One of the main arguments I see against this that nobody who's not already a fan of the Mario series is going to have any idea who she is. I'm willing to bet most of the people reading this post don't. This, however, is a poor argument, as most casuals don't actually care all that much about which characters are playable. Casuals aren't going to abandon the game simply because they don't recognize the cute purple ghost. Also, adding her and making her a staple would bring much needed life to the Mario rosters. The Mario spinoff rosters have gotten pretty stagnant in the last 20 years, and having a fresh face would inject new life into a stale cast. She's also a fan favorite, which means that a lot of casual fans are going to be more interested in checking her out after hearing about all the hype around her."
"When we think of “American Values” we think of things like freedom of speech, freedom of religion, all people created equal and having equal opportunity and equal rights, due process protection under the law, etc. And Trump doesn’t stand for any of those. This is not up for debate as it’s irrelevant to my view that I’m looking to have changed. All of those are fake values that have never really been a part of American history. They have been talking points and theoretical aspirations. America’s real values are about persecution and tribalism. We founded this country with the declaration that all men are created equal with a document signed by slave owners. Persecution is in our country’s DNA. Between slavery, Jim Crow, McCarthyism, Japanese internment camps, and many many others, America has always been about persecuting those less fortunate. So if America’s real values are about persecution, then Trump is doing a bang-up job at representing those values."
"World War 2 was a pretty black and white ideological war that a ""bad guy"" actually started and invaded others with the allies stepping in to just ""right the wrong"" and ""stop the bad guys"". But in world war 1 there was a huge grey area and it wasn't as clear who the bad guys were, this is also evidenced by regular people both not knowing the cause or saying things like ""who did we fight"" in ww1. Apparently people thought it would be over in a few months, with battles lasting more than a day being considered long at the time. Nobody knew the sheer destruction that things like artillery and other technological advancements would bring. So with that and conscription and trench warfare it was also a more traumatising war for soldiers than ww2, even though the latter killed more. With ww2 potentially losing was invasion, loss of freedom, possibly genocide, etc. It was pretty black and white for the average person. But what consequences would losing ww1 have that the average citizen was concerned about? Not much. It was rich old men sending young men to die for politics."
"The letter Y deserves the honor of being included in the pantheon of vowels, not just a participation trophy of 'sometimes,' and I am angry on its behalf. We were all taught that the vowels are ""A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y."" However, it occurred to me recently that the letter Y seems to ALWAYS behave like a vowel. For example, it would make practically no difference to spell the word 'yellow' as 'iellow', 'yuck' as 'eeuck', or ""worry"" as ""worrie"". It does the exact same thing as a vowel. (Now, saying ""eeuck,"" out loud, I notice a little glottal stop right when I start the 'ee' sound that isn't there with the y, and IMO this makes the 'ee' seem even more consonant-y than the 'y' in comparison) Now I am aware of the fact that Y is linguistically considered ""semivowel"" or a ""glide"" and I must say this seems fishy to me. Mirriam-Webster defines a semi-vowel as: a speech sound (such as \y, \w, or \r) that has the articulation of a vowel but that is shorter in duration and is treated as a consonant in syllabication."
"In the final scenes of the Rambo movie, there is a famous monologue by Stallone where he says a bunch of things against the people who opposed the war and how they spat on veterans when they returned. But he also lets slip that ""Somebody didn't let us win"". Was this a common accusation back then? Among veterans? or people pro-war? I've heard the accusations of spitting on veterans many times and the arguments against, but never had heard this accusation that the veterans felt they could have won if somebody had left them. Was this a talking point after the Vietnam War? Maybe by the time the Rambo movie was out. As far as I know, none of the major figures involved in the production of the movie were Vietnam veterans. David Morrell was Canadian; Stallone was too young, the actor for Trautman was in WW2, and the actor for Teasle was stationed in Korea after the war. The cinematographer was in a cinema unit in Korea, and the directors and producers seem to not have been involved in either war. So...this line must have come from someone not in Vietnam."
"In a recent podcast episode, Michael from Vsauce references an idea called the Bicameral Mind Theory, referencing Julian Jaynes author Brian McVeigh who has written and spoken about it. In summary, he claims that people did not begin to have conscious, ""I""-focused experiences until roughly 1000 BCE. He presents two main strains of evidence. First, the records of dreams from before this time all seem to be along the lines of being visited by an angel or other being where they were sleeping, instead of being weird and experiential (""I met a horse but the horse was my mom and we were on the beach""). Secondly, he presents early works such as the Iliad as having characters motivated by the voices and commands of gods instead of internal motivations such as are seen in the Odyssey. How accurate is this description to the historical record vis-a-vis recorded dreams and the motivations of characters in ancient literature? I'm particularly curious also if this is seen at all in the writings of non-European cultures, such as China."
"Basically the title. Roman society was deeply stratified along class lines, employing slavery and only offering the privilege of entering politics to those who had never experienced it. The aristocracy justified their role in society through claims of lineage to deities and/or historical figures. And yet despite this strict stratification, successive Roman governments continually invested in highly effective and durable public infrastructure such as public fountains, sewage, and aqueducts that benefitted the elite, the freeborn, freedmen and slaves alike. How were these expertly crafted designs funded as a public project, and not as a privilege exclusive to citizens like the corn dole? In modern Western society, we justify the funding of public infrastructure through principles like egalitarianism and the welfare state, but this funding is constantly threatened by discussions of whether the lowest stratum of society is 'freeloading' off of them. Did similar debates ever arise during the decades-long planning and building processes of Roman public infrastructure?"
"In this radical rethinking of modernity, Professor Clifton Crais argues that the era between 1750 and the early 1900s – seen by many as the birth of the Anthropocene – should instead be known as the Mortecene: the Age of Killing. Killing brought the world together and tore it apart, as violence and commerce converged to create a new and terrible world order that drove the growth of global capitalism. Profiteering warlords left a trail of devastation across Africa, Asia, and the Americas, committing mass-scale slaughter of humans and animals, and sparking an environmental crisis that remains the most pressing threat facing the world today. Drawing on decades of scholarship and a range of new sources, The Killing Age turns our vision of past and present on its head, illuminating the Mortecene in all its horror: how it has shaped who we are, what we value, what we fear, and the precarious planet we must now confront."
"HMS Dreadnought revolutionized warship design with a much simpler layout of both armament and armor, focusing on a few very large caliber guns and getting rid of the multitude of smaller calibers present on previous ship designs. Question is then, why was this general philosophy never implemented on wooden ships of the line? Why not have a single, very well protected gun deck with a dozen total 50+ pounder cannons as opposed to three gun decks with a ton of varied but much smaller and less effective guns? Such a design, would in theory have many advantages such as being able to both out range enemies, while also having more effect on target, and, if displacement was the same, would also make the ships much less top-heavy. It certainly wasn't really a question of being unable to produce cannons of that size as Columbiads were in use, but limited to coastal installations."
"I want to post my story here and see if anyone can relate. I have a CPTSD diagnosis by at least 3 practitioners including 1 expert witness psychologist. A couple years ago when I got my promo to P4 (principal position at an engineering job), it felt like I experienced time travel and was ""instantly"" cowering in the corner of my boss's office, looking down at a 45 degree angle against the wall. It was so vivid, and I still clearly remember the tan texture of the wall and the late afternoon lighting from the windows. I actually remember being there and I have no idea what was happening in my actual self. I assume I was interacting with my boss normally somehow, keeping a conversation or whatever I was doing, since otherwise I'm sure he would have called 911 if he noticed something was up. I don't remember leaving his office or even anything else that happened that day. It was the weirdest thing I've ever experienced in my life. For years I told my therapist that I actually had cowered in the corner, until one day I looked at it logically and realized there's no way that memory is real. Anyone have anything similar happen to them?"
"My physical health has been awful for the past year, I'm suffering a lot physically every day. While I look for an answer and try to accept I might be chronically ill, I just don't feel real at all, and I think depersonalization is the only thing blocking me from getting depression, I feel like my ego and self is locked somewhere and I’m just a shell going on everyday through pain hoping ill break free from the health issues and gain back my old self, also scared it might never happen. The only trouble with getting out of bed is how dizzy I feel, I don't lack motivation, and I'm still able to find joy in some things like music but I spent most of the day daydreaming about getting my health back. I don't know why I'm posting, think I just want to vent, I don't know if anyone is going through something similar."
"I realized today that DPDR is most likely related to a memory-based disruption that can be triggered by various factors. It interferes with thinking, self-perception, and the sense of personality or reality. It is often caused by excessive stress or anxiety, and in many cases there is a main trigger behind it. Triggers can include traumatic experiences, depression, or anything that makes you feel stuck, as if you are in a deep hole with no way out. When that happens, it can feel like you are frozen at one point in time. It is as if you have lost your reference points. You can’t look back, you can’t look forward, and that lack of grounding increases anxiety and intensifies DPDR. At its core, it feels like a loss of reference. The good news is that you can work on this, although it is a gradual process and not something that changes overnight. What can help is looking back and finding your reference points again. These can be memories from times when you felt normal or more connected. Try to actively place yourself back into those moments. Remember what you thought, how you reacted, and what that experience felt like. Do this without comparing it to how you feel now, and try to view the memory neutrally, without a negative emotional charge."
"Anyway, I was super anxious back in August and had this really weird feeling of fear strike me when I looked at this super modern bizarrely shaped building. I couldn’t get over WHY I was having that reaction as nothing like that had ever happened to me before. It scared me to death and I still think about it. I’ve had ocd tendencies since I was a kid and began to suffer intrusive thoughts and repetitive thinking as well in August. I had a few days around this period of time where I felt like the sound of my voice was weird to me and the look of my arm was weird too. I’d also look out the window and think “this is the world?” It has all been thought-based. Nothing has ever looked different to me in any way. I have felt like I was losing my mind from the overwhelm and the constant thoughts that were child-like in nature like wondering about how the world came to be."
Starting off we've been together for 11 years. I've supported him through 5 major manic episodes throughout our relationship. The past few days I started to recognize his early patterns before he has an episode and can get him to calm down and it stops. But this one is different. He's been heavily smoking wax past few weeks. Past week he has been sleeping and eating less and less and now his behavior is scary. He's back to going off on random people who he thinks is judging him whenever we go. He thinks I'm cheating and then gets mad when I'm not because he wants to be a cuck (totally not him). I'm afraid this time he might actually hurt me because when he speaks to me and he's angry it's with so much hate like I murdered his whole family. His last episode about 2 years ago (Trigger warning sexual trauma) he sexually assaulted me and got arrested then sent to the psych ward and was in there for a month by force.
"Please can anyone offer advice? My brother is in psychosis, and can hardly remember any facts. Recently he said he forgot how old he was, has no notion of what time of the year it is, is going around accusing us all of bizarre things like spying on him, putting poison in his food, and thinks we are plotting against him. He has been involuntarily hospitalized twice, and he refuses point blank to see anyone to get mental health support. He smokes multiple times a day despite us saying often that he has a problem and needs to stop. I think he has a substance misuse disorder. When I told him it would be helpful for him to see someone he told me I was manipulating him and weaponizing therapy. I’ve seen people here emphasizing the importance of maintaining the person’s trust, but he doesn’t trust me at all. However I have truly no idea what I did to possibly lose his trust because we’ve always been close and had a wonderful relationship and he started acting like he thought I was evil because I accidentally published a Spotify playlist with lyrics he thought I was using to insult him."
"Last night I had a dream where I was at the same house that I had Thanksgiving at merged with my house, not like half and half but everything seemed perfectly familiar but not equal to both Houses and it was just me and my elderly mother, I looked in a mirror in the bathroom and the whole room froze in the mirror but not in the dream and I saw it but my mom was right there and didn't see the mirror differently, this repeated a few more times until one time I only saw my face in a twisted manner frozen in a frame in the mirror I got spooked in my dream its like the mirror knew, I then moved onto a semi familiar kitchen but it had a mirror not similar to either house and it froze one more time onto my face where I tried showing my mom one more time, she saw it didn't believe then disappeared, then I thought I left my dream but then in shifted into me walking through my town with my sister and going to my middle school bus stop from 15 years ago. Then I actually woke up, the same time I'd have to wake up for school all those years ago."
"So I just had one of the most vivid dreams of my life and had to write it down. In it, I found myself in what seemed like a parallel world or maybe way in the future. Everything felt advanced, clean, almost utopian—but I was being chased for reasons I don’t really remember. At one point I told a crowd of people that I was from Earth, from Illinois, and from the year 2025. They looked at me like I was crazy. I asked what year it was, and someone said 2686. That’s when I realized I must have time traveled. I told them that in 2025, we still hadn’t cured cancer. A woman in the crowd laughed a little and said, “Lithium Lithography, of course!” That phrase hit me so hard I woke up immediately. I’d never heard it before in my life, but it was burned into my brain. Out of curiosity, I looked it up and sure enough, lithium and lithography are real scientific terms that intersect in extreme ultraviolet light (EUV) technology. And EUV actually is being explored in cancer research."
"I go to a pretty normal mid-sized university. Nothing fancy. At the start of the year, housing assigned me a random roommate — let’s call him D. When we first met, he seemed quiet, awkward, but friendly enough. He was a comp-sci major who mostly kept to himself, liked energy drinks a little too much, and played a ton of gacha games. Honestly, he reminded me of half the guys I know. Everything seemed normal for the first month. He’d stay up late, but whatever — college. Then slowly… things got weird. At first, I noticed he’d close his laptop really fast whenever I walked in. Again… fine. We’re all adults. But it kept happening. Sometimes at 3 – 4 AM when I’d wake up to use the bathroom and see the glow of his screen. Then I started finding tissues on the desk, earbuds on the floor, his laptop open with incognito tabs still visible. Awkward, but not a crisis… until it escalated."
"I’ve been stuck in this loop lately where everything I do feels wrong even when I’m doing exactly what I’m supposed to like I’ll say something normal to someone and immediately my brain starts ripping it apart like why did you say it like that or why are you like this or why can’t you just act like a normal person for once and it’s not even about other people it’s me being exhausted with myself. I’m tired of the way I think, the way I react, the way I overanalyze every tiny thing until it becomes this ugly version of reality that only exists in my head. I hate how predictable I am. How I pull back when someone gets close, how I make myself small in conversations, how I panic over the dumbest things and then pretend I’m fine because explaining it out loud makes me sound insane."
"There used to be a clear path to fame: you sang, acted, wrote, created art, competed in sports, something that demonstrated skill or accomplishment. Fame was a byproduct of talent. Now we have influencers who are famous for being famous. They don't sing. They don't act. They don't create meaningful art. They just exist photogenically online and monetize attention. I'm not saying it's easy to build a following or that there's no work involved. But it's fundamentally different from what celebrity used to mean. So what shifted culturally to make this viable? Is it social media democratizing fame? Is it that we value relatability over excellence now? Is it just that attention itself has become a commodity and the source doesn't matter anymore? There's something strange about a world where being watched is the skill, rather than doing something worth watching."
Anyways our finances aren't that great right now. I'm still in university and he isn't doing too well either with money. Last weekend he was on call with his family on speaker phone and they accidentally let slip about the presents he got for her without talking about it with me. He got her a laptop which he claims it's going to be for both of them. Realistically though he would barely use it and she will use it for her roblox. The other present is a scooter. I feel like they are too pricey to be getting for a kid especially since he had to borrow money to do that. He already owes his credit card a lot and now he owes his friend too. I was really upset but I didn't say anything except that he should have talked to me about it. Our goal is to pay off his debts and start saving money so we can eventually get our own place but that seems further and further away the more he does this. So I just told him to not get me any presents because he should just pay his debts off instead.
"I want to learn how to program video games, but I cannot code much to save my own life. I can do everything involving design, but not coding. Tutorials tend to leave you blanked when you leave them as they only provide case-specific examples, meaning the best ways to learn tend to involve trying to achieve what you want and learning from your mistakes. The problem is that game engines do not let you stumble around and find out what happens when you type in what, they all have unique syntax designs, but generally speaking, you cannot get started without knowing what words go where and under what circumstances, and you could never know enough to restrict your behavior. This means you cannot guess your way around any programming languages as they are textual with no nuance, not visual with components you can experiment with. This means, for every unique case of wanting to create something unique or new, I would have to know exactly what to type and what not to type."
"I booked a 7 day cruise with my girlfriend and I told her I would pay the cost of it to make up for a previous thing I wronged her on. On the cruise, there are also gratuities that are more or less ""mandatory"" to pay to the tune of about $110. We had not talked about me paying for that. As part of a promotion with booking the cruise, I got $150 credit that could be used for any purchase on the ship. In addition, I used a credit card which I pay $700 a year for, but which gave me an additional $200 credit, for a total of $350. I told her that I had credits and I would pay for the cost of her gratuities and I sent her over the money. While I was at guest services, she found out that I actually had $350 and got very upset that I was ""hiding"" this from her and she demanded that I give her half of my credits. Her reasoning was that we are a couple and this was a cruise I was supposed to share half of everything. I argued that I paid a lot of money to get my extra $200 credit and I was already covering every obligatory cost for the cruise, like I had agreed to."
"Almost a month ago me and my friend had a discord chat in a VC, for the past two months up until that point, we had chatted like we had known each other our whole lives. He's always been very kind and betrays himself as someone who is tough as nails. not caring when people insult him. But after a call we had almost a month ago, he got very upset with me and left the VC. I'm still not entirely sure if this is right but I've tried to piece this together. I don't have much social experience growing up since I grew up in Asia, but this is what happened. During a conversation, we were both quite eager to talk to one another, since we were both quite busy at the time, and hadn't had the chance to have a chat in a while. So after finding the time, we started to chat about anime and power scaling, this being the first time we talked about stuff like anime."
"Little Esther, who was just over five feet tall, was pretty tough herself, showing up in Nashville to sing country songs in a way that no one who appeared at the Grand Ole Opry would ever have attempted. Black musicians had been singing hillbilly music for decades, and they had even played on some of the first country records, made in the twenties and thirties. But by the early sixties, Music City was lily-white. Things have changed somewhat today; there are a fair number of Black country singers, such as Mickey Guyton and Kane Brown. But progress hasn’t been easy. Just look at the backlash against Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter. Phillips entered this fray before any of those modern pioneers was born. And the album that resulted from her Nashville sessions — eventually titled The Country Side of Esther Phillips — is an ignored classic, a collection of country covers that sounds as soulful and sad today as it did six decades ago."
"In the fall of 2022, the Amsterdam-based lawyer received a call from a Dutch model who had converted about $1.5 million of his family’s savings into bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, and sent it to someone posing as an investment adviser — who turned out to be a fraud. The victim had hired a crypto analytics firm to trace the stolen cryptocurrency along the blockchain through various crypto wallet addresses — the equivalent of bank accounts — until the trail stopped at what looked like a promising destination: a wallet address at Huobi Global, a major crypto exchange that said it complied with anti-money laundering rules. Hupkes sent an email to Huobi demanding it freeze the suspicious wallet and reveal the name of its owner. In an email signed “Huobi Regulatory Cooperation,” anonymous company representatives referred the lawyer to authorities in Seychelles, the secrecy jurisdiction in the Indian Ocean where the exchange was registered at the time. Hupkes went to court."
"The case for face transplants seemingly made, several teams scrambled to perform their nation’s first. The US saw the first partial face transplant (2008), then the first full one (2011); the first African American recipient (2019); the first face and double hand transplant combined (2020); the first to include an eye (2023). There have been about 50 face transplants to date, and each milestone brought new grants, donations and prestige for the doctors and institutions involved. The patients, meanwhile, continue on living as they can. Some of them, like Isabelle, have suffered greatly. Others, like Joe DiMeo, who received the world’s first double hand and face transplant at NYU Langone in 2020, find new ways to forge a career by selling their stories online. But he and his wife Jessica, a nurse, are constantly trolled, and the spectre of rejection never leaves."
"With standard tuning, the bottom five notes on the guitar – E, F, F sharp, G, G sharp – can be played only on the open and first four frets of the sixth string. But once you go above the A at the fifth fret on the sixth string (which is the same pitch as the fifth string played open), we have entered into the world of identical pitches playable in more than one location on the fretboard. The most places you would find any single pitch practically usable on the guitar is in four different positions. For many notes, there are three comfortably possible locations. But when you build chords around those, that means that chords can be voiced or played in multiple different positions as well. Open strings have a different timbre from strings that are stopped, so that’s a factor too. If you’re sight-reading on the piano, the notes you’re reading can be sounded only by playing one specific key on the keyboard. But the guitar is very different. Each positional choice you make produces sounds with a different character. It’s not infinitely complex, but complex enough. With that comes a fascinating and wide range of expressive possibilities."
"Esther gave up her adolescence to be a star, but life on the road was rough: no sleep, bad food, a bunch of weed-smoking blues musicians. Sometimes her dressing room was a bathroom. Things were even worse in the South, where the group had to find Black hotels and diners and where Esther witnessed terrible things. “I’ve seen Black women beat with clubs,” she remembered later. “Police beat them with clubs in auditoriums, and everybody was scared to move.”  Not all of their road adventures were terrifying. One night in the South the bus pulled into a filling station, and Otis saw Hank Williams standing outside his limousine. Otis was a fan and introduced himself — and found that the feeling was mutual. He introduced Esther to Williams, and the three talked while gassing up. After they got back on the bus, Esther’s mother asked what took so long, and her daughter, clearly unimpressed by the exchange, said, “Johnny and I were off talking to some cowboy.” Otis corrected her: “Don’t you know that cowboy was the great Hank Williams?” Lucille screamed, “Johnny Otis, you turn this bus around. I have to meet that man!”"
"While police agencies from various countries investigated criminal networks suspected of using wallets owned by the St. Vincent company, Kyrrex’s executives touted a Malta-licensed affiliate as fully transparent and compliant with anti-money laundering laws in an effort to access the lucrative European market. The Kyrrex case shows how crypto exchanges, which often claim that transparency is a core component of their business, combine trading practices like nesting with complex corporate structures and shell companies in secrecy jurisdictions to evade scrutiny from authorities and everyday crypto users alike. Paul Beckett, a lawyer specializing in offshore finance, said the complex structures allow firms like Kyrrex to sidestep oversight. “Malta, respectable, ‘that’s the one we tell the world about,’ ” he said. “St. Vincent is the ugly sister, and that’s where the mischief happens.” The result, he added: “absence of accountability of any kind.”"
"César Cielo was about to turn 23 when he set the world record, while Gkolomeev is 32. The drugs helped close the age gap and shave off 0.02 seconds — or 20 milliseconds. Not really worth it, considering he just lost the ability to represent his country in the next Olympic Games or any professional competition governed by world swimming organizations. At least he earned $1 million, which was his motivation after 14 years as a pro, during which he made about $200,000 total. He said that he’ll be competing next May in the Enhanced Games in Las Vegas, where the organizers plan to feature swimming, track, and weightlifting events. If Gkolomeev wins again, he’ll collect another $1 million. The essay also mentioned that U.S. world champion sprinter Fred Kerley will compete in the track events during the games. I understand that people will do all kinds of things to earn enough money to sustain themselves and their families. I don’t really blame the athletes testing the waters with performance-enhancing drugs in hopes of winning millions of dollars in the Enhanced Games, but I do question the ethics of the people promoting this cause."
"At dusk, when the church bells tolled from the hilltop of Toboso, the air itself turned sepia and alive. A lone rider often passed through, his horse ribbed and reluctant, the kind that seemed imagined from yellowing parchment and a tourists fatigue. He called himself Juan Christoforo de la Blanco, though none could recall him among the living of the village. They said he was the last descendant of a mad Hidalgo who once charged the windmills of La Mancha, and that he, too, had mistaken them for giants. But this one did not tilt at them, he listened. Each night he was dismounted by the ruins of a centuries old monastery turned hotel, where monks once copied the saints’ torments by candlelight. He pressed his ear against the crumbling stone and swore he heard quills scratching beneath the earth, writing still. “The story; it is not finished,” he’d whisper. “The knight, he rides on.”"
"Wanaka is located near Mount Aspiring National Park in the Southern Alps. Situated by Lake Wanaka, New Zealand’s fourth largest lake, Wanaka is surrounded by majestic mountains in every direction. It boasts of being a great spot to enjoy the outdoors and offers several hiking trails. It was an incredibly scenic drive through the mountains, filled with lots of twists and turns, to get from Queenstown to Wanaka. We arrived in the early afternoon and headed to Lake Wanaka to see That Wanaka Tree. The small solitary willow tree is reputed to be one of the most photographed trees in New Zealand because of its unique location of appearing semi-submerged in the shallow water. You can probably imagine just how busy the beach was with tourists trying to capture the perfect shot. The tree is looking a bit shabby these days. It sustained damage over the years from tourists climbing on it. And more recently some loser sawed off a few branches during the middle of the night in 2020. People always have a way of ruining things."
"Keynes predicted in 1930 that by 2030, automation would reduce the need for work to just 15 hours per week. We’re almost there, so what did he get right and wrong? First, most people work fewer hours in less physically taxing jobs than their grandparents did. But we’ve standardized on 40 hour weeks, and much more for people in jobs with a high degree of competition. Within those 40 hours, I am reliably informed, some people struggle to perform even a single hour of meaningful work, but these are not the rule. On the other hand, Keynes was absolutely correct that cumulative capital increase would lead to radically higher GDP and standard of living. If anything, he underestimated how resourceful we could be in finding new things to make and spend money on. This doesn’t surprise me much. Even in Keynes’ time, mechanization of much of labor had increased US GDP by a factor of four or five since the end of the civil war, and probably a factor of 20 since pre-industrial times."
"The ridge must have washed out sometime in the last couple of weeks. I stood at the edge of the trail where runoff had carved a gully through the packed earth, exposing tree roots twisted through the dirt. Murky water still pooled at the bottom. I could backtrack. Add an hour, maybe two. Or I could cut through the trees, parallel the trail for a few hundred yards, rejoin it past the damage. Honestly it would be quicker just to go overland and cut out the switchback entirely, it was probably less than a mile. The forest here was old growth Douglas fir, the canopy thick enough to turn noon into twilight. Sword ferns everywhere, thick clumps of salal between the trees. But it looked passable. I checked my phone out of habit. No signal, hadn't been one since the last fire road. I pushed into the trees. The ground caved under my boots. Soft with rot and moss. Humid air pressed against my face, carrying the smell of decomposition and wet bark. My breathing was loud. The rustle of my pack against my shoulders. I picked my way between the ferns, trying to maintain a straight line. The washed-out section couldn't be more than a quarter mile. "
"Quantum computers work differently from normal computers because they use the principles of physics. Regular computers use bits that are either 1 or 0, like a switch that can only be on or off. This works fine for everyday tasks but it limits what the computer can do. Quantum computers use qubits, and these qubits can be both 1 and 0 at the same time. This gives the computer the ability to check many possibilities at once instead of doing them one by one. Because of this, quantum computers can solve problems that regular computers would take years to finish. The special way quantum computers work makes them very helpful for science and medicine. For example, scientists often struggle to study how different drug molecules react in the body because there are too many details for a normal computer to process. A quantum computer can handle these details better, helping experts discover new treatments faster. This technology can also help researchers create new materials for batteries, solar panels, and other tools that can improve daily life. In short, quantum computers give scientists a more powerful way to test ideas and find solutions."
"""Elk don't stretch like that, Miller. Nothing does."" We kept moving. The sun began to dip, casting long, bruised shadows through the trees. The temperature dropped, freezing the mud into jagged ridges. The second anomaly appeared two miles later. Usually, a wounded animal heads downhill, towards water and thick cover. It takes the path of least resistance. This thing was climbing. It was heading straight up a scree field, a forty-degree incline of loose shale that would break a horse's leg. And the blood had changed. It was no longer bright and frothy. It was dark, almost black, and it smelled... wrong. Not like copper and iron. It smelled like bile and wet limestone. ""I don't like this,"" Hayes muttered, looking up the slope. The wind was picking up, whistling through the dead pines. ""It's leading us."" ""It's dying, Hayes. It's confused."" ""It's not confused. Look at the trail."" He pointed. The blood trail wasn't erratic. It was a straight line. Perfectly straight. The animal hadn't stumbled once. We pushed up the screen, our boots sliding on the loose rock. When we crested the ridge, the light was failing. We entered a dense stand of old-growth spruce, the canopy so thick it choked out the sky. It was dark in there, a gloom that felt heavy and pressurized. That’s when we heard it."
"It is for this reason that, upon his recent death, my sister and I were left with the long, arduous task of sorting through the library of paperwork that the man left behind. When I call the collection a “library”, I do so without an ounce of hyperbole: his vast hoard of papers easily filled an entire large room’s worth of drawers, files and shelves. We knew we’d have to handle his Last Will and Testament when he passed, and knowing our old man, we figured it would be a headache to get through, but at the time we thought this one document would be the worst of it. We had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. Upon diving into his extensive collection of records, we were both genuinely surprised by how many old documents the man had hung onto over the years, even long after their usefulness had dried up. Bank membership forms from the 1970s for banks long-since defunct; half-century-old grocery store receipts hand-written in blotchy, messy, ink; parking tickets paid lifetimes ago for cars he hadn’t owned in decades; it was all there, filed away neatly in the darkness of his old office, waiting for the day that we’d have the displeasure of drawing it all back out into the light."
"When selecting a president, the public attributes importance to experience, leadership, and moral values. Still, one question keeps popping up: is it a must for a president to possess a college degree? At first, it feels like a logical assumption. A degree is generally an indicator of a specific intellectual and disciplined level. However, if we examine the matter more closely, it’s not as straightforward as it appears. Personally, I think a college diploma should not be the criterion for the presidency. A degree does not denote that the person is definitely more enlightened or able to do more. A large number of people go through college, learn things by heart, get their degrees, and then find it hard to exercise good judgment or use common sense. A similar number of great leaders, inventors, and philosophers chose not to complete their college education but still managed to build companies, create jobs, tackle complex problems, and above all, win the hearts of millions. The art of leading is not merely imparted through lectures in a classroom."
"Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.” “We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother, resentfully, “since we are not to visit.” “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.” “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her.” “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you.” Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters. “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.” “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times them ill.”"
"“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.” The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense, nonsense!” “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books, and make extracts.” Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how. “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr. Bingley.”"
"It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter’s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty. With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints."
"Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in “the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass."
"At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his arms,—clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,—and limped towards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people, stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in.  When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When I saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of my legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on again towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or the tide was in."
"The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting.  The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation."
"“The only unofficial consulting detective,” he answered. “I am the last and highest court of appeal in detection. When Gregson or Lestrade or Athelney Jones are out of their depths—which, by the way, is their normal state—the matter is laid before me. I examine the data, as an expert, and pronounce a specialist’s opinion. I claim no credit in such cases. My name figures in no newspaper. The work itself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case.”  “Yes, indeed,” said I, cordially. “I was never so struck by anything in my life. I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of ‘A Study in Scarlet.’”  He shook his head sadly. “I glanced over it,” said he. “Honestly, I cannot congratulate you upon it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid.”"
"Our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional appearance.  “I’m sure it must look very bad, Mr. Holmes, and I am not aware that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before. But I will tell you the whole queer business, and when I have done so you will admit, I am sure, that there has been enough to excuse me.”  But his narrative was nipped in the bud. There was a bustle outside, and Mrs. Hudson opened the door to usher in two robust and official-looking individuals, one of whom was well known to us as Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard, an energetic, gallant, and, within his limitations, a capable officer. He shook hands with Holmes and introduced his comrade as Inspector Baynes, of the Surrey Constabulary."
"“Brilliant, Watson. You are scintillating this morning. If it is not column, then I am very much deceived. So now, you see, we begin to visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a considerable length, since one of the words is numbered in the document as the two hundred and ninety-third. Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?”  “I fear that we have.”  “Surely you do yourself an injustice. One more coruscation, my dear Watson—yet another brain-wave! Had the volume been an unusual one, he would have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had intended, before his plans were nipped, to send me the clue in this envelope. He says so in his note. This would seem to indicate that the book is one which he thought I would have no difficulty in finding for myself. He had it—and he imagined that I would have it, too. In short, Watson, it is a very common book.”"
"This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve found it,” he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hæmoglobin, and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.  “Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.  “How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit. “You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.”"
"Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.  In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns."
"“It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?” She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind."
"But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose eyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages. "
"Then my father came out with the metal — a good, strong piece. He looked at me with both eyes but I had not run away. He gave me the metal to hold — I took it and did not die. So he knew that I was truly his son and would be a priest in my time. That was when I was very young — nevertheless, my brothers would not have done it, though they are good hunters. After that, they gave me the good piece of meat and the warm corner of the fire. My father watched over me—he was glad that I should be a priest. But when I boasted or wept without a reason, he punished me more strictly than my brothers. That was right. After a time, I myself was allowed to go into the dead houses and search for metal. So I learned the ways of those houses — and if I saw bones, I was no longer afraid. The bones are light and old — sometimes they will fall into dust if you touch them. But that is a great sin. I was taught the chants and the spells — l was taught how to stop the running of blood from a wound and many secrets. A priest must know many secrets — that was what my father said."
"A police photograph of Harrison Bergeron was flashed on the screen-upside down, then sideways, upside down again, then right side up. The picture showed the full length of Harrison against a background calibrated in feet and inches. He was exactly seven feet tall. The rest of Harrison's appearance was Halloween and hardware. Nobody had ever born heavier handicaps. He had outgrown hindrances faster than the H-G men could think them up. Instead of a little ear radio for a mental handicap, he wore a tremendous pair of earphones, and spectacles with thick wavy lenses. The spectacles were intended to make him not only half blind, but to give him  whanging headaches besides. Scrap metal was hung all over him. Ordinarily, there was a certain symmetry,  a military neatness to the handicaps issued to strong people, but Harrison looked like a walking junkyard. In the race of life, Harrison carried three hundred pounds."
"I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the land of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I will disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically industrious — painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour — but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore."
"I followed them, at a distance, waiting for what would happen. My heart was troubled about going east, yet I knew that I must go. My head hummed with my fasting—I did not even see the panther spring upon the white fawn. But, before I knew it, the bow was in my hand. I shouted and the panther lifted his head from the fawn. It is not easy to kill a panther with one arrow but the arrow went through his eye and into his brain. He died as he tried to spring—he rolled over, tearing at the ground. Then I knew I was meant to go east—I knew that was my journey. When the night came, I made my fire and roasted meat. It is eight suns' journey to the east and a man passes by many Dead Places. The Forest People are afraid of them but I am not. Once I made my fire on the edge of a Dead Place at night and, next morning, in the dead house, I found a good knife, little rusted. That was small to what came afterward but it made my heart feel big. Always when I looked for game, it was in front of my arrow, and twice I passed hunting parties of the Forest People without their knowing. So I knew my magic was strong and my journey clean, in spite of the law."
"Richard looks the way I picture guys on sailboats—tall, blond, and very tucked-in, even on weekends. Or maybe I picture guys on sailboats that way because Richard loves to sail. His legs are very long, and they don’t really fit under our kitchen table, so he has to sit kind of sideways, with his knees pointing out toward the hall. He looks especially big next to Mom, who’s short and so tiny she has to buy her belts in the kids’ department and make an extra hole in her watchband so it won’t fall off her arm. Mom calls Richard Mr. Perfect because of how he looks and how he knows everything. And every time she calls him Mr. Perfect, Richard taps his right knee. He does that because his right leg is shorter than his left one. All his right-foot shoes have two-inch platforms nailed to the bottom so that his legs match. In bare feet, he limps a little."
"Stanley had to remove his clothes in front of Mr. Sir, who made sure he wasn't hiding anything. He was then given two sets of clothes and a towel. Each set consisted of a long-sleeve orange jumpsuit, an orange T-shirt, and yellow socks. Stanley wasn't sure if the socks had been yellow originally. He was also given white sneakers, an orange cap, and a canteen made of heavy plastic, which unfortunately was empty. The cap had a piece of cloth sewn on the back for neck protection. Stanley got dressed, and the clothes smelled like soap. Mr. Sir told him he should wear one set to work in and one set for relaxation, noting that laundry was done every three days. On that day, his work clothes would be washed. Then the other set would become his work clothes, and he would get clean clothes to wear while resting."
"While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my eyes, as long as she took no notice of me. I “never told my love” vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked a return—the sweetest of all imaginable looks. And what did I do? I confess it with shame—shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.  By this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how undeserved, I alone can appreciate."
"She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet; her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a child’s ready to cry.  Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on me from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us. I began to doubt whether he were a servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of a domestic’s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house. In the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my uncomfortable state."
"It was still dark, with only the moon and stars providing light—more stars than Stanley had ever seen before. It seemed like he'd just fallen asleep when Mr. Pendanski came in and woke everyone up. Using all his might, Stanley brought his shovel down onto the dry lake bed. The force stung his hands but made no impression on the earth. He wondered if he had a defective shovel. Glancing over at Zero, about fifteen feet away, he saw him scoop out a shovelful of dirt and dump it onto a pile that was already almost a foot tall. For breakfast, they'd been served some kind of lukewarm cereal. The best part was the orange juice—they each got a pint carton. The cereal didn’t taste too bad, but it smelled just like his cot. Afterward, they filled their canteens, grabbed their shovels, and were marched out across the lake. Each group was assigned a different area. The shovels were kept in a shed near the showers. They all looked the same to Stanley, although X-Ray had his own special shovel, which no one else was allowed to use."
"There isn’t a lot of time for practice tonight because it’s tenant-meeting night. Once a month, the neighbors sit in our living room and complain while Mom takes notes in shorthand. Most people don’t bother to come. It’s always the old folks, who don’t get asked to go many places and are mad that there isn’t more heat. Sal’s mom, Louisa, works in a nursing home, and she says old people can never get enough heat. After the meetings, during which Mr. Nunzi has usually burned a new hole in our couch with his cigarette, Mom always writes a letter to the landlord and sends a copy to some city agency that’s supposed to care whether we have hot water, if the lobby door locks, and that the elevator keeps getting stuck between floors. But nothing ever changes. Our doorbell is going to start ringing any minute. Mom is running through a few speed rounds with Richard while I make lemonade from frozen concentrate and open the Oreos. Louisa knocks her regular knock and I answer the door with the plate of cookies. She takes an Oreo and sighs. She’s wearing jeans with her white nurse shoes, which she kicks off by the door. She hates these meetings but comes out of loyalty to Mom. And someone has to watch Mr. Nunzi’s cigarette to make sure he doesn’t accidentally set our apartment on fire."
"Buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. To be sure, it was an unwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. But when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger’s hands, he growled menacingly. He had merely intimated his displeasure, in his pride believing that to intimate was to command. But to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck, shutting off his breath. In quick rage he sprang at the man, who met him halfway, grappled him close by the throat, and with a deft twist threw him over on his back. Then the rope tightened mercilessly, while Buck struggled in a fury, his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely. Never in all his life had he been so vilely treated, and never in all his life had he been so angry. But his strength ebbed, his eyes glazed, and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car."
"They were all terribly footsore. No spring or rebound was left in them. Their feet fell heavily on the trail, jarring their bodies and doubling the fatigue of a day’s travel. There was nothing the matter with them except that they were dead tired. It was not the dead-tiredness that comes through brief and excessive effort, from which recovery is a matter of hours; but it was the dead-tiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil. There was no power of recuperation left, no reserve strength to call upon. It had been all used, the last least bit of it. Every muscle, every fibre, every cell, was tired, dead tired. And there was a reason for it. In less than five months they had travelled twenty-five hundred miles, during the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days’ rest. When they arrived at Skaguay they were apparently on their last legs. They could barely keep the traces taut, and on the down grades just managed to keep out of the way of the sled."
